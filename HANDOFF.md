# PayIncus Handoff

Last updated: 2026-06-29 CST

This file is a handoff note for a new Codex conversation. Do not include server passwords or other secrets in this file.

## Repository

- Local path: `/Users/max/Documents/incudal`
- Main product repository: `git@github.com:VipMaxxxx/payincus.git`
- Current local branch: `master`
- Target remote branch: `payincus/main`
- Repository history: default branch was rebuilt as an independent PayIncus baseline on 2026-06-27; a local mirror backup was kept for private audit traceability.
- Public documentation source: `docs-site/docs`
- Note: the old private `docs/production-audit.md`, `docs/full-function-audit.md`, and `docs/commercial-operation-task-goals.md` files are not present in the current tracked checkout. Treat the current worktree, `HANDOFF.md`, generated version logs, tests, and production/live proof output as authoritative.

## Current Git State

Use `git log --oneline --decorate -5` as the authoritative current HEAD because this handoff may receive handoff-only commits after product releases. The latest product/docs release baseline at the time of this refresh was:

```text
34f07dd6e Update version log for v1.2.1
```

GitHub remote `payincus/main` should be aligned with the current local HEAD after each handoff-only refresh. Use `git status --short --branch` and `git ls-remote payincus refs/heads/main` as the source of truth instead of copying this note forward.

The current local tree should be clean after pulling `payincus/main`. Do not reset if new local changes appear; inspect them first.

Latest product/docs release boundary at the time of this refresh:

```text
6fcf173f1 Release v1.2.1 exchange withdrawal hardening
```

## Latest GitHub Release Work

`v1.2.1` is published on GitHub and has release artifacts. Production OTA task `#124` deployed `v1.2.1` successfully and switched `/opt/incudal/current` to `/opt/incudal/releases/v1.2.1-20260629113553`.

`v1.2.1` hardens the Exchange Marketplace withdrawal path after the `v1.2.0` rollout: admin withdrawal action buttons are status-driven, completed/rejected terminal withdrawals no longer expose action buttons, and completing a withdrawal now requires a payment proof URL or transfer reference in both the admin UI and backend route.

Production proof for task `#124`:

## Active Exchange Marketplace Work

The current worktree contains the `v1.2.1` Exchange Marketplace implementation. Code, release, OTA, non-destructive production checks, and at least one real production Exchange delivery path have been proven. Remaining proof is narrower: keep capturing real dispute refund/release, seller settlement, withdrawal review, and rollback/retry evidence as those paths are exercised.

Implemented local scope:

- User Exchange entry and pages: market, detail, sell/listing workflow, my listings, buys, sales, wallet, withdrawals, records, disputes.
- Admin Exchange Management: overview, listings, orders, delivery tasks, wallets, withdrawals, disputes, risk records, config, audit logs.
- Market/listing UI now explicitly shows remaining validity, forced reinstall delivery, anonymous trading, escrow, bandwidth/traffic/IP summary, and order/delivery started-finished timestamps for proof review.
- Instance detail mutation UI now carries the Exchange lock into config/change-host/swap/boost controls, in addition to backend locks, so listed or delivering instances do not present ordinary mutation actions.
- Database models and migration for `exchange_listings`, `exchange_orders`, `exchange_delivery_tasks`, `exchange_wallets`, `exchange_wallet_logs`, `exchange_withdrawals`, `exchange_disputes`, `exchange_audit_logs`, and `exchange_policy_configs`.
- Paused-only listing checks, anonymous public/user serialization, listing/dispute contact-info rejection, sensitive operation verification, idempotency, escrow wallet logs, manual withdrawal review, dispute paths, and operation locks across instance, billing, snapshot, backup, proxy-site, traffic-reset, transfer, host, public API, and admin billing surfaces.
- Delivery worker chain: rechecks seller ownership and stopped status, cleans old access/bindings/snapshots/risk samples, queues buyer-owned forced rebuild, waits for rebuild completion, anonymizes Incus/display identity, transfers owner, rebuilds buyer billing relation, preserves the listing instance's current traffic usage and remaining quota, returns real delivery started/finished timestamps, enters confirmation period, and supports retry/refund/manual takeover/manual completion.
- Admin Production Proof now includes an operator-status `交易所真实交割闭环` item and a live E2E record template, so the admin UI does not present the Exchange Marketplace as production-complete until real proof is captured.

Latest create-instance Turnstile fix:

- User create-instance page now renders a visible `TurnstileWidget` whenever public config has `turnstileEnabled` and `turnstileSiteKey`.
- Submit now reads the visible widget token, the widget model value, and the Cloudflare hidden response input before sending the order request; if no token is available, it blocks locally with localized Chinese/English/TW copy and scrolls/focuses the verification area instead of sending an empty-token request to the backend.
- The create button is no longer disabled solely because Turnstile has not produced a token yet, so users can click it to trigger the local verification prompt and the hidden-input fallback can run.
- Turnstile backend error codes `TURNSTILE_TOKEN_MISSING` and `TURNSTILE_VERIFICATION_FAILED` now have localized Chinese/English/TW copy, and Turnstile codes take precedence over raw backend `details` in the frontend error translator.
- Raw backend/Cloudflare Turnstile messages such as `Turnstile verification required`, `Turnstile verification failed`, `missing-input-response`, and `invalid-input-response` are now mapped to localized frontend copy as a fallback.
- Flash-sale and normal create flows keep separate Turnstile action names through the widget action prop.

Latest registration Turnstile fix:

- Registration now resets the Cloudflare Turnstile challenge token after verification-code or registration failures such as an incorrect invite code.
- The reset only clears the consumed Turnstile token/widget state and keeps the already-filled registration form values intact, so the user can correct the invite code and submit again without refreshing the whole page.
- The existing visible Turnstile widget remains the only source of a fresh token; the backend still validates Turnstile normally before account creation.

Latest Exchange Marketplace hardening:

- `v1.1.0` fixes forced-reinstall delivery after a real production failure: delivery now stops the rebuilt Incus instance before rename/ownership transfer and persists the delivered instance as `stopped`, because Incus refuses to rename a running instance.
- Exchange public config now exposes a fuller non-sensitive policy summary for users: listing age windows, markup cap, confirmation policy, IP transfer policy, withdrawal daily limits, max active listings, max daily purchases, and dispute timeout.
- Exchange purchase secondary verification now treats `exchange_purchase` as an account operation with listing-ID scoping, so the verification modal can send and verify codes without `Resource ID is not allowed for this operation`.
- Anonymous public Exchange snapshots now keep safe nested host/package/package-plan display data and renewal billing price while still hiding the original instance ID/name and user identity fields.
- Exchange market API and UI now expose/filter by package categories from visible listing snapshots, and cards/details show node, package, plan and renewal price with safer fallbacks.
- Existing stopped instances whose package/plan is now inactive or sold out remain tradeable as remaining-use-right assets; purchase-time checks still block risk, overdue, expiring, task-running, storage, traffic-limit and ownership problems.
- Public market listing, public detail, listing create/update, and purchase now synchronously reject expired `autoDelistAt` windows, so an expired listing cannot remain browsable or purchasable while waiting for the background auto-delist worker tick.
- The `stop-for-listing` route now explicitly checks the Exchange operation lock before queuing a stop task, so an already listed, locked, or ordered instance cannot be sent through the pre-listing pause shortcut.
- User Exchange UI now loads a non-sensitive public policy summary from `/exchange/config`; the purchase modal only exposes buyer reinstall image selection when the current Exchange policy allows it, and otherwise submits without `imageAlias`.
- User Exchange wallet UI now reflects the public policy: balance transfer is disabled with a clear reason when the policy disallows it, withdrawal inputs enforce/display the configured minimum amount, and both flows explain risk checks, second verification, and manual withdrawal review before submission.
- Exchange dispute creation now rejects empty reasons at the service boundary, not only in the user route/UI, while keeping the existing contact-info and identity-disclosure filters.
- User instance batch renew and batch auto-renew actions now exclude exchange-locked paid instances in the UI and in the submitted ID list; the backend exchange operation lock still remains the authoritative enforcement layer.
- `paused` Exchange listings are now treated as locked/blocking everywhere the Exchange status can protect an instance: generic operation lock, listing eligibility, internal instance task creation, and destroy routes. Delivery-failed listings and failed Exchange orders are also covered by the destroy lock, so manually paused or failed Exchange states cannot bypass deletion or ordinary instance tasks.
- User instance list and instance detail listing-state now also include `paused` Exchange listings, showing `交易所暂停中` and keeping action buttons locked instead of falling back to a misleading `可上架` or `待检测` state.
- Buyer purchase now rechecks listing eligibility immediately before escrow and balance charge, covering seller status, stopped instance state, policy allowlist, overdue/expiring state, risk state, package/plan/host availability, traffic limits, seller order restriction, storage pool availability, and duplicate active orders.
- Delivery worker now persists each forced-reinstall handoff cleanup step to `exchange_delivery_tasks.progress`, including seller freeze, terminal/session cleanup, network binding cleanup, snapshot/backup cleanup, SSH key cleanup, and console token cleanup before the rebuild is queued.
- Delivery progress steps are now aligned so initial purchase uses `escrow_paid` and admin retry resumes at `lock_instance` instead of storing out-of-band `lock_order` or `retry_queued` steps that the UI progress list does not understand.
- User listing update now supports the intended partial edit contract: price, description, and auto-delist time can be changed without resubmitting `instanceId`; if a caller supplies `instanceId`, the service still rejects attempts to switch the listed asset.
- Admin policy allowlists for packages and hosts are normalized server-side into positive unique integer IDs, so direct API calls cannot persist string or malformed allowlist entries.
- Sellers can now delist both `active` and `paused` listings from the user Exchange page; `paused` is displayed as `暂停挂牌中`, while locked delivery/failure states remain protected.
- Admin withdrawal approve and complete actions now recheck that the seller account is active and has no active order restriction, open Exchange disputes, or unsettled sales/confirmation-period orders before approving or paying out.
- Exchange delivery task `step` now stays within the documented progress steps during reinstall; lower-level instance task progress is preserved under `progress.instanceTaskProgress`, avoiding raw or unknown steps such as `reinstall_queued` in user/admin delivery progress.
- Exchange-sensitive password viewing and terminal access now use a separate lock: active/paused/locked/delivery-failed listings and escrowed/delivering/manual-review/failed orders block non-admin access; after forced rebuild reaches delivered/confirming/disputed, only the buyer who owns the rebuilt instance can access it.
- The public non-sensitive Exchange config endpoint is explicitly treated as public in route guards, matching the user purchase UI that needs policy flags before login-sensitive actions.

Remaining proof before claiming 100%:

- No `.env`, `.env.production`, `server/.env`, or `server/.env.production` existed in this checkout during the latest local audit; local production checks were run with explicit environment variables.
- Production OTA task `#122` ran artifact download, SHA verification, migration check, service restart, split-host, production-readiness, and log/header secret checks successfully on the production release artifact.
- Latest production OTA proof covers artifact install, migrations, service restart, split-host, production readiness, log-header checks, public health, and deployed package version.
- Real production Exchange delivery has been observed after the v1.1.x fixes: buyer balance purchase, escrow hold, forced rebuild, anonymous handoff, transfer owner, rebuilt billing relation, and confirmation-period entry. Continue to capture live proof for seller settlement, withdrawal review, dispute refund/release, retry/manual takeover, and rollback paths.
- Do not reuse old server credentials from earlier conversations without the operator explicitly providing current access again.

The current `v0.9.9` bundle includes the `v0.9.0` commercial-operation baseline plus the follow-up OTA/smoke/UI/capacity hardening:

- `v0.9.1`: split auth smoke now runs from production artifacts through `dist/scripts/smoke-split-auth.js`.
- `v0.9.2`: split auth smoke is Turnstile-aware; without `SMOKE_TURNSTILE_TOKEN`, it treats enforced Turnstile as a protected login proof and skips the login-chain portion instead of failing the OTA.
- `v0.9.3`: OTA update and rollback workers use atomic task-claim guards to avoid duplicate workers mutating the same task.
- `v0.9.4`: duplicate OTA workers close the Prisma database connection before returning, so skipped duplicate oneshot services exit cleanly instead of hanging.
- `v0.9.5`: global `bg-themed-surface` now has solid light/dark backgrounds, fixing transparent admin risk evidence drawers and other themed cards; generated version logs filter handoff/version-log sync commits from user-facing unreleased changes.
- `v0.9.6`: public package sold-out checks now include disk capacity, keeping market availability aligned with backend instance creation checks; production readiness warnings and docs now describe CPU, memory, and disk capacity requirements.
- `v0.9.7`: admin resource-risk evidence drawer now renders above admin chrome with solid light/dark backgrounds for the drawer, snapshot cards, tables, and JSON evidence blocks.
- `v0.9.8`: resource-risk evidence drawer uses scoped opaque panel/surface/code backgrounds that survive admin theme CSS and Tailwind output changes; production readiness now makes empty payment callback IP whitelist warnings explicit about the still-required signature, status, amount and idempotency checks, and DB readiness identifies active providers without built-in callback IP defaults.
- `v0.9.9`: public installer, local environment initializer, atomic OTA migration and live acceptance report now use PayIncus public branding while preserving `/opt/incudal`, the `incudal` system user, the `incudal-backend` service name and artifact names for runtime/OTA compatibility; split-deploy guard coverage prevents old public-facing Incudal titles from returning.

The `v0.9.0` commercial-operation baseline includes:

- Integration Center: admin entry, backend health-check routes, persisted health history, and docs coverage for SMTP, Lsky, Telegram, payment providers, global notifications, remote storage, Agent/Incus, OTA, extension market, and theme market.
- Billing and payment operations: manual recharge provider flow, payment-provider secret handling guards, plugin gateway refund workbench, refund reconciliation cases, and safer payment detail redaction.
- Delivery and plan-upgrade hardening: delivery-center guard updates, plan upgrade capacity guard updates, and plan-upgrade sync repair service.
- Extension Center hardening: high-risk capability review records, enablement blocking for unapproved high-risk capabilities, capability review docs, market submission UI guard updates, and runtime capability guard updates.
- Resource risk operations: pagination and source-scoped order restriction work from `v0.8.9` remain the production baseline; current docs and guard coverage continue to reflect that behavior.
- Split deployment/docs: README and docs-site now emphasize split user/admin domains, empty `COOKIE_DOMAIN`, `/api` proxying, production proof refs, and `INCUDAL_AGENT_RELEASE_REPOSITORY=VipMaxxxx/payincus`.

```

Remaining before calling the whole commercial-operation objective complete:

- Current `v1.0.0` production OTA is complete and verified. `v0.9.4` final-acceptance proof remains the latest full live proof report; `v1.0.0` passed OTA production checks.
- `DEBGP` production capacity warning was closed operationally on 2026-06-27 by setting package `#3` (`DEBGP`) `active=false`; package data and host binding were preserved for later re-enable after capacity is added.
- `PAYMENT_CALLBACK_IP_WHITELIST` remains empty by operator decision. Production `.env` now sets `PAYMENT_CALLBACK_IP_WHITELIST_REQUIRED=false`, so production readiness records this as an explicit no-fixed-source-IP policy while keeping `PAYMENT_CALLBACK_SKIP_IP_WHITELIST=false` and preserving signature/status/amount/idempotency requirements.
- `v1.0.0` hardens the host Agent against CPU/log pressure: default heartbeat 60s, minimum 30s, Incus state concurrency 3, 500-instance report cap, non-running instances skip `/state`, heartbeat log throttling, and generated `incudal-agent.service` CPU/memory/task/journal rate limits. Existing hosts must rerun the Agent installer after release to refresh old service templates. Production `/opt/incudal/agent-release` now serves Agent manifest `v1.0.0`; already-installed Agents can self-upgrade their binary, but systemd CPU/memory/journal limits still require rerunning the installer because the binary upgrade does not rewrite the unit file.
- With Turnstile enabled and no `SMOKE_TURNSTILE_TOKEN`, split auth smoke verifies Turnstile enforcement and skips the full login-chain smoke. Provide a valid Turnstile token if a full automated login-chain proof is required.
- Keep watching the high-risk surfaces touched by `v0.9.0`: Integration Center health checks, manual recharge, refund/reconciliation workbench, extension capability review blocking, delivery/plan-upgrade sync repair, and split user/admin login boundaries.

## v1.0.1 Release Summary

- Target version: `v1.0.1`.
- Scope: dedicated IPv4 and dedicated IPv4 + dedicated IPv6 delivery, host public IPv4 IPAM, package network mode cleanup, and consistent resource rollback.
- IPv6 NAT is intentionally not a new target capability. `nat_ipv6_nat` and `ipv6_nat` remain only for legacy data compatibility.
- Local validation completed:
  - `DATABASE_URL='postgresql://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/payincus' pnpm --filter server exec prisma generate` passed.

  - Pages run `28295942452` passed for `main`.

## v1.0.2 Release Summary

- Target version: `v1.0.2`.
- Scope: Welfare daily check-in now grants random points instead of resource-pool credits, admin check-in settings/logs, database-backed daily claim guard, and instance card network/quota markers.
- The daily claim guard uses `daily_checkins(user_id, date_key)` plus per-user points locking, so concurrent requests cannot double-claim the same Beijing calendar day.
- Local validation completed:
  - `DATABASE_URL='postgresql://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/payincus' pnpm --filter server exec prisma generate` passed.

  - Pages run `28312344320` passed for `main`.

## v1.0.3 Release Summary

- Target version: `v1.0.3`.
- Scope: hosted package publish/unpublish controls, active package storage-pool binding hardening, Incus certificate path fallback after OTA, and Germany `DEBGP` production package recovery.
- Active packages now resolve each bound host to an `instance_data` storage pool before save/activation. Empty per-host storage selections fall back to the host's preferred system disk pool, prioritizing `default`; activation is blocked if no usable pool exists.
- Incus client and terminal proxy certificate reads now fall back from stale release-specific paths to the stable panel certificate directory under `/opt/incudal/server/certs` or configured panel certificate environment variables.
- Local validation completed:
  - `pnpm --filter server test:incus-certificate-paths` passed.
  - `pnpm --filter server test:package-input-guards` passed.
  - `pnpm --filter server test:package-host-type-guards` passed.
  - `pnpm --filter server test:frontend-i18n-keys` passed.
  - `pnpm --filter server type-check` passed.

  - CI run `28313256856` passed for `main`.
  - Pages run `28313256855` passed for `main`.

## v1.0.4 Release Summary

- Target version: `v1.0.4`.
- Scope: resource-risk policy hardening, complete QoS tier controls, read-only strategy simulation, manual-state preservation, automatic QoS recovery, and user-side order-restriction warning.
- Resource-risk QoS tiers now carry trigger score, recover score, minimum limited duration, downgrade cooldown, continue-downgrade switch, user notification switch, and per-tier order restriction switch. Old three-field tier JSON is still parsed with safe defaults.
- Admin Resource Risk policy page now exposes the complete tier table and a read-only simulation panel showing sampled instances, would-trigger count, would-limit count, would-restrict count, would-suspend count, tier hits, and top projected-risk instances before saving the policy.
- Automatic evaluation now preserves `manual_qos_limited` and `manual_suspended` states until an operator releases them, restores original bandwidth after recovery thresholds and minimum duration, and avoids marking QoS active when the Incus host is offline and no bandwidth limit was actually applied.
- A dedicated `resource_risk_qos_limited` notification template was added. The instance creation page now checks the user's resource-risk status on load and shows an upfront review-ticket action when the account has an active resource-risk order restriction.
- Local validation completed:
  - `pnpm --filter server type-check` passed.
  - `pnpm --filter client type-check` passed.
  - `pnpm --filter server test:resource-risk-guards` passed.

  - Build & Release run `28328429131` passed for tag `v1.0.4`.
  - Docs Pages run `28328427964` passed for `main`.
  - Public GitHub API rate limit was reached before CI run `28328427937` could be rechecked to completion; local full gates passed and the Release assets/manifest were verified by direct asset URLs.
  - Direct asset checks returned HTTP 200 for linux amd64/arm64 tarballs, sha256 files, `incudal-v1.0.4-ota-manifest.json`, and `ota-manifest.json`.
  - Public `ota-manifest.json` reports version `v1.0.4`, amd64 SHA256 prefix `d621c14b21f7`, and arm64 SHA256 prefix `76e62b2cec35`.

## v1.0.5 Release Summary

- Target version: `v1.0.5`.
- Scope: flash-sale campaigns for instance packages, multi-item campaign management, user-side flash-sale listing/purchase entry, stock reservation audit trail, and guarded billing/provisioning integration.
- Flash-sale purchases now flow through the normal instance creation path with Turnstile, resource-risk order restriction, user status, email/account-age checks, stock locking, per-user limits, balance accounting, delivery compensation, and AFF commission base fixed to the flash price.
- Admin flash-sale management supports multiple campaign items per campaign, item-level price/stock/per-user/coupon/AFF settings, reservation listing, stock adjustment, and campaign/item audit logs.
- Local validation completed:
  - `DATABASE_URL='postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/incudal' pnpm --dir server exec prisma validate` passed.

  - Docs Pages run `28330144309` passed for `main`.
  - GitHub Release assets are available for linux amd64/arm64 tarballs, sha256 files, `incudal-v1.0.5-ota-manifest.json`, `ota-manifest.json`, the AI ticket agent plugin bundle, and plugin market index.
  - Public `ota-manifest.json` reports version `v1.0.5`, commit `4d0dd50dda2b`, amd64 SHA256 `fe937b24769872c5a135a68f2488a1942d4fddfa2762cb2208972610ca577802`, and arm64 SHA256 `b3935ff868586053c136818518c6613c5f0c8a82b94e042028faf1a988b1ddda`.
  - Public `https://pay.payincus.com/api/health` and `https://admin.payincus.com/api/health` returned HTTP 200 before production OTA.
  - Online docs `https://payincus.com/release/version-log` and `https://payincus.com/en/release/version-log` contain `v1.0.5`.
- Production OTA status: pending current production SSH or authenticated admin system-update access. Do not mark production as upgraded until a system-update task succeeds and `/opt/incudal/current` plus production health/version checks prove `v1.0.5`.

## v1.0.6 Release Summary

- Target version: `v1.0.6`.
- Scope: flash-sale post-creation editing for generated campaigns and campaign items.
- Admin flash-sale campaigns can now be edited after creation: name, description, start/end time, Turnstile requirement, email requirement, minimum account age, risk-restricted account blocking, max-per-user and internal notes.
- Admin flash-sale items can now be edited after creation: flash price, total stock, per-user limit, coupon allowance and AFF allowance. Existing reservation/order records are not rewritten; edits only affect later purchases.
- Backend adds `PATCH /api/admin/flash-sales/items/:itemId` with validation, audit logging and stock protection so stock cannot be reduced below sold plus reserved counts.
- Local validation completed:
  - `pnpm test` passed.
  - `pnpm build` passed.
- GitHub checks / release proof:
  - Build & Release run `28330666051` passed for tag `v1.0.6`.
  - CI run `28330664384` passed for `main`.
  - GitHub Release assets are available for linux amd64/arm64 tarballs, sha256 files, `incudal-v1.0.6-ota-manifest.json`, `ota-manifest.json`, the AI ticket agent plugin bundle, and plugin market index.
  - Public `ota-manifest.json` reports version `v1.0.6`, commit `5c8d3b8e1493`, amd64 SHA256 `f3133918e57d8b3672c9ce0ca92971cce897958644b7153041cd68ae05185591`, and arm64 SHA256 `24cedfca6b08f59cab399ffc9a6611258f1fe4a6d5cdbe9ce707c05b2bbc8104`.
- Production OTA status: release package is ready. Apply production OTA only after current production SSH or authenticated admin system-update access is available and record the resulting task id plus health/version proof.

## v1.0.7 Release Summary

- Target version: `v1.0.7`.
- Scope: normal instance creation Turnstile enforcement and compact user-side instance card layout.
- User instance creation now requests a Turnstile token for normal package orders when global Turnstile is enabled, not only for flash-sale orders. The page also shows a visible verification-required hint before submit.
- Backend `POST /api/instances` now applies the shared Turnstile verifier to normal instance creation before order/resource work. Flash-sale creation keeps its campaign-level eligibility and Turnstile validation so the same token is not consumed twice.
- User instance cards now fit three columns on wide desktop screens while preserving list/card mode and existing instance actions.
- Local validation completed:
  - `pnpm --filter server test:instance-create-turnstile-guards` passed.
  - `pnpm --filter client type-check` passed.

## Latest Production OTA Proof

- Production version: `v1.0.4`
- Release tag commit: `2bd25ba5a`
- Current production symlink: `/opt/incudal/current -> /opt/incudal/releases/v1.0.4-20260628162711`
- OTA task: `108`, status `success`; from version `v1.0.3`; log path `/opt/incudal/update-logs/system-update-108.log`.
- GitHub Release assets for `v1.0.4` are available, including linux amd64/arm64 tarballs, sha256 files, `incudal-v1.0.4-ota-manifest.json`, and `ota-manifest.json`.
- Production checks passed during and after OTA: split host verification, `pnpm verify:production`, health checks for user/admin/backend APIs, and Agent manifest check.
- Independent checks after OTA:
  - `https://pay.payincus.com/api/health` returned HTTP 200.
  - `https://admin.payincus.com/api/health` returned HTTP 200.
  - Local backend `http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/health` returned HTTP 200.
  - `package.json` under `/opt/incudal/current` reports `1.0.4`.
  - OTA log shows `System update completed successfully`.
  - Task `108` database row printed as `success` with `errorMessage=null`; the ad-hoc Prisma query command timed out on process exit after printing, so use the OTA log as the primary proof if rechecking.
  - Production DB has `DEBGP` active, bound to host `DE-01` with `storage_pool_name=default`.
  - Production host certificate paths for `DE-01` point to `/opt/incudal/server/certs/client.crt` and `/opt/incudal/server/certs/client.key`.
  - Direct Incus storage-pool check against `DE-01` returned `/1.0/storage-pools/default`.
  - Public API `https://pay.payincus.com/api/packages/public?source=official` returns `DEBGP` with host id `6`.
  - Production DB contains `daily_checkins`.
  - Production system configs contain `checkin_enabled=true`, `checkin_min_points=1`, `checkin_max_points=500`, and `checkin_require_instance=false`.
  - Production DB contains `public_ipv4_pools` and `public_ipv4_addresses`.
  - `pnpm verify:production` on production passes and records the empty payment callback IP whitelist as an intentional policy because `PAYMENT_CALLBACK_IP_WHITELIST_REQUIRED=false` is set.
  - Online docs `https://payincus.com/release/version-log` and `https://payincus.com/en/release/version-log` contain `v1.0.4`.
  - Deployed admin bundle contains `resource-risk-evidence-panel` and generated CSS with `background-color:#fff;opacity:1`, plus dark-mode opaque surface/code backgrounds.
- Production readiness currently logs one WARN: public package `#3` (`DEBGP`) is active but online bound hosts cannot satisfy its minimum CPU/memory/disk requirement. Storage-pool visibility and Incus connectivity are fixed; add Germany capacity or lower/package-disable the plan before relying on new paid orders.

Historical note:

- Duplicate-start verification on task `97` found the `v0.9.3` skipped-worker path could leave Prisma open and keep the systemd oneshot active. `v0.9.4` fixed that path and verified the duplicate service now exits cleanly.

## Latest Independence / Docs Release Work

`v0.8.8` rebuilt the public project identity and developer-facing release artifacts:

- Default branch history was rebuilt as an independent PayIncus baseline and force-pushed to `payincus/main`; local mirror backup: `/Users/max/Documents/payincus-history-backup-20260627143322.git`.
- Public README, docs site, deployment docs, extension center docs, theme docs, OAuth/Public API docs and release notes no longer reference the retired upstream project.
- `LICENSE` and package metadata now use PayIncus/VipMaxxxx ownership language.
- Public API TypeScript SDK and examples are tracked under `docs-site/docs/public/sdk`.
- Official extension templates and the clean theme template now track their `dist` and `docs` artifacts explicitly despite global `dist/` and `docs/` ignore rules.
- Release workflow wording is PayIncus-branded while keeping existing artifact names and `/opt/incudal` runtime paths for OTA compatibility.
- Local validation before release: server type-check, docs-site build, old-reference scan, system update guard, Public API OpenAPI/resource/SDK guards, OAuth Provider guard, extension runtime/package/template/market guards, theme guard, frontend i18n guard, agent install command guard.

Known follow-up:

- Superseded historical note: current production warning status is tracked in "Latest Production OTA Proof" above. Do not use this old v0.8.8 note as the current capacity source of truth.

## Latest Instance Upgrade Work

`v0.8.7` fixed paid instance plan upgrade resource and bandwidth consistency:

- User-side and admin-side plan upgrades now perform host capacity checks against the instance's current host before charging or updating the instance.
- Upgrade capacity checks use the resource delta between the current instance and target plan, then lock the host row with `FOR UPDATE` during the transaction to prevent concurrent over-allocation.
- CPU, memory, and disk are all checked; disk capacity now also participates in available-host filtering for new purchases.
- Plan upgrade transactions update host usage counters from projected aggregate usage, avoiding the previous post-upgrade counter increment pattern.
- Upgrades now update `limitsIngress` and `limitsEgress` in the database and call Incus bandwidth restore so the displayed bandwidth and actual instance bandwidth are aligned.
- User preview and admin upgrade plan lists expose `resourceCapacity` / `resourceWarnings`; unavailable upgrade targets are disabled in the admin modal.
- New guard coverage: `pnpm --filter server test:plan-upgrade-capacity-guards`.

## Latest Resource Risk Work

`v0.8.4` added the instance-scoped resource risk center:

- Collects bandwidth Mbps, PPS, packet deltas, and CPU usage samples from Incus traffic polling.
- Scores instances only; accounts are linked through the source instance and can be restricted from new orders/requires manual ticket review.
- Supports QoS tiers from the admin policy page, defaulting to 50 Mbps, 30 Mbps, and 10 Mbps thresholds.
- Supports CPU sustained usage, sustained bandwidth, packet anomaly, and small-packet scan suspicion signals.
- Supports automatic instance suspension when `autoSuspendEnabled` is enabled and score reaches `autoSuspendScore`; default is currently disabled to avoid first-rollout false positives.
- Adds user review ticket flow when `ORDER_RESTRICTED_BY_RISK` blocks instance creation.

`v0.8.5` hardened OTA:

- The OTA runner now explicitly runs `pnpm --filter server exec prisma generate` after `prisma migrate deploy` in artifact atomic, artifact legacy, and git fallback update paths.
- `server/scripts/test-resource-risk-guards.ts` now checks the key risk policy fields and auto-suspend/order-restrict service wiring.

`v0.8.6` added manual resource risk controls:

- Resource risk policy QoS tiers now use structured numeric rows instead of a CSV textarea; each row has level, bandwidth Mbps, and trigger score.
- Admins can manually limit a risky instance's bandwidth and optionally restrict the linked account from new orders.
- Admins can manually suspend or unsuspend an instance from the resource risk center; manual suspension writes risk events, updates the instance state, and can notify the user.
- Admins can manually restrict the linked account from ordering when a specific instance needs ticket review.
- Backend validation rejects invalid QoS tiers, invalid scores, missing manual reasons, and invalid manual bandwidth values.

`v0.8.9` refined the resource risk center operations UI:

- Instance, event, and order restriction tables now paginate at 10 rows per page and recover to the last valid page after row removal.
- Instance action buttons now reflect current state: suspended instances show unsuspend, active source-scoped restrictions show release order restriction, and unrelated account restrictions show a disabled account-restricted state.
- Manual order restriction release is now source-scoped. Releasing a restriction from one risk instance only releases that instance's active restriction record, and no longer presents every risky instance under the same account as independently releasable.
- Backend instance list now returns both the current instance's active order restriction and the linked account's newest active restriction so the UI can distinguish same-source and other-source account restrictions.

Production warnings observed during `pnpm verify:production`:

```text
PAYMENT_CALLBACK_IP_WHITELIST is empty; provider-specific defaults apply only where the backend implements them.
Public package #1 (HKCMI) is active but online bound hosts cannot satisfy its minimum CPU/memory requirement.
```

These are existing operational warnings and did not block the `v0.8.1` OTA.

Important release-chain note:

```text
v0.6.7 contained the extension platform and theme system feature bundle, but its Release failed on the frontend route guard and must not be used for OTA.
v0.6.8 fixed the extension platform release guards and deployed successfully through production task #74.
v0.6.9 fixed the public extension/theme market domain to payincus.com.
v0.6.10 adds the guarded gift card center.
v0.6.11 adds the guarded operations settings center.
v0.6.12 fixes admin gift card generation being blocked by the Turnstile gate.
v0.6.13 adds the visible user gift-card Turnstile verification page.
v0.6.14 fixes reliable user gift-card Turnstile token submission and redeemed-card list visibility.
v0.6.15 persists expired gift-card status outside the rolled-back error path.
v0.6.16 fixes gift-card user Turnstile body-token verification by moving the check after body parsing.
v0.6.17 polishes public/user/admin UI structure, help search, gift-card safety UI, Extension Center tab routing, docs, and guard coverage.
v0.6.18 includes the instance card and auto-name feature commit but its Release failed on frontend boundary guard and must not be used for OTA.
v0.6.19 fixes the instance transfer path boundary guard and was the previous production boundary.
v0.8.1 hardens storage pool sellability/creation guards, fixes loop storage source handling, adds user self-service instance traffic reset, and is the current production boundary.

The admin console contains a read-only Production Proof workspace at /admin/production-proof.
The user build output does not contain the production-proof route, nav key, or page content.
Production `v0.6.6` is live after the final-proof scope waiver release and artifact-mode live-acceptance fix. Current proof progress is complete for the operator-approved scope: 12 proof items are verified, and Lsky confirmed deletion/provider cleanup is explicitly waived by the operator rather than tested.
Latest OTA proof: task `#73` updated `v0.6.5 -> v0.6.6`, switched `/opt/incudal/current` to `/opt/incudal/releases/v0.6.6-20260625151558`, and finished with `System update completed successfully`. Manual current-release checks confirmed version `v0.6.6`, commit `9fcbe2867efa`, backend `active`, `SERVER_NODE_MODULES_OK`, `pnpm verify:production`, and `pnpm verify:log-header`.
Final live acceptance report: `/tmp/incudal-proof/final-acceptance-v0.6.6.md` ended with `final_go_status: live_proof_references_documented` and `status: automated_checks_completed`. In artifact mode, `agent_release_smoke` is recorded as skipped because production preflight verifies the Agent manifest; this avoids the old `tsx` dev-dependency failure in production artifacts.
Production `v0.5.3` showed the production DB backup/restore drill as verified in the read-only proof workspace and is now an older rollback release.
Production Lsky proof script is deployed at `server/dist/scripts/lsky-production-proof.js`. Latest read-only proof `lsky-upload-delete-proof-2026-06-25T14:33:18.929Z` confirmed config present, API v2 host `kkksr.com`, group endpoint HTTP 200, token permission endpoint HTTP 200 with redacted summary output, token abilities only include `upload:write`, missing `user:photo:read` and `user:photo:write`, and `/api/v2/user/photos?page=1&per_page=1` returned HTTP 403. Commit mode was not run. The operator then explicitly said this cleanup proof does not need testing, so record it as a scope waiver and never as confirmed deletion.
Official Lsky Pro+ API docs confirm `DELETE /api/v2/user/photos` expects a JSON numeric ID array and returns HTTP 204 on successful deletion. The current production code matches this endpoint/body shape. A later production DB-only known-ID search `lsky-db-known-id-readonly-search-2026-06-25T04:54:26.080Z` found `attachmentCount=0` and no Lsky providerFileId in matched business log rows, so there is no safe persisted proof image ID to delete from the app side.
Current code review confirms there is no safe no-upload/no-known-ID deletion proof path: `deleteTicketImageFromLsky()` requires a numeric Lsky v2 provider ID before it sends `DELETE /api/v2/user/photos`, and the proof script refuses commit mode while `/api/v2/user/photos` returns HTTP 403. Do not probe production with guessed IDs, empty delete arrays, or invalid-ID delete requests.
Production DB backup/restore drill is proven through a temporary database restore and cleanup check.
Production Incus lifecycle is proven on dedicated test instance #9: stop task #5, start task #6, restart task #7, recreate task #8, delete cleanup, DB status deleted, Incus object not found, and host CPU/memory/disk resources returned to baseline.
Telegram delivery is proven by production bot message #339 to public group @Payincus.
Turnstile/session browser smoke is proven through the approved temporary disable-and-restore path: user /dashboard and admin /admin/production-proof rendered after login, config restored, temp secret file removed, and test users #31/#32 banned.
SMTP provider reference is proven by production send-test proof `smtp-provider-reference-2026-06-25T04:34:51.773Z`: recipient domain `qq.com`, provider reference `35bd2e0d-e817-1e31-ffde-de033e861c7e@qq.com`, accepted=1, rejected=0, pending=0, response `250 OK: queued as.`.
Remaining production proof for the current operator-approved scope is closed. Lsky confirmed deletion/provider cleanup is waived by operator decision, not tested. If this is later reintroduced, configure a delete-capable Lsky token with `user:photo:read` and `user:photo:write`, use a wildcard token, or perform provider-side cleanup before commit-mode proof; previous proof images may still need cleanup. Once that is available, run `LSKY_PROOF_COMMIT=1 ENV_FILE=/opt/incudal/.env NODE_ENV=production node server/dist/scripts/lsky-production-proof.js` and prove `DELETE /api/v2/user/photos` returns success/204 for its numeric provider ID.

The previous `v0.5.3` release chain was verified locally by the targeted guards, client/server build/type-check, docs version-log generation, docs build, diff hygiene, remote main/tag refs, public Release artifact availability, GitHub Build & Release/CI/Pages success, and production deployment/readiness proof. Final production acceptance still remains pending until the remaining real business proofs are captured.

```text
pnpm --filter server test:production-proof-center-guards
pnpm --filter client type-check
pnpm --filter client build
pnpm --dir docs-site --ignore-workspace build

```

The latest release chain was refreshed for `v0.5.4`: GitHub Build & Release/CI/Pages succeeded, production OTA task `#61` completed successfully, public user/admin health checks passed, docs version-log pages contain `v0.5.4`, and server-side admin dist grep confirmed the live production-proof chunk contains the new `12/13` progress plus SMTP/Lsky remaining-proof wording.

pnpm --filter server proof:lsky
pnpm --filter server build

```

The latest release chain was refreshed for `v0.5.6`: GitHub Build & Release/CI/Pages succeeded, production OTA task `#63` completed successfully after running the official updater runner manually, public user/admin health checks passed, docs version-log pages contain `v0.5.6`, and production now includes the repeatable read-only/commit-mode Lsky proof script. The script remains in read-only preflight mode by default and refuses commit-mode upload while the configured Lsky token cannot list user photos.

Local gates run for `v0.5.7`:

pnpm --filter server type-check
pnpm --filter server build
pnpm --filter server test:lsky-production-proof-guards
pnpm --dir docs-site --ignore-workspace build
git diff --check
```

The `v0.5.7` release hardens the online update/rollback runner environment: systemd update units now set a stable PATH, the runner checks required commands before mutating state, child processes inherit the stable PATH, ownership repair avoids shell interpolation, and artifact copies no longer depend on shell `cp -a`. Public Release assets and docs version-log proof passed. Production task `#64` completed successfully after running the official updater runner manually from the previous `v0.5.6` release; public health, production readiness, split-host, DB readiness, Agent manifest, log/header exposure, deployed runner markers and deployed systemd PATH template markers passed.

pnpm --filter client type-check
pnpm --filter client build
pnpm --filter server type-check
pnpm --dir docs-site --ignore-workspace build

```

The `v0.5.8` release updated the read-only admin production-proof workspace to show SMTP as verified and the remaining proof count as `1`: only Lsky deletion/provider cleanup. GitHub Build & Release run `28164941815`, product CI run `28164938942`, version-log CI run `28164985317`, and Pages run `28164985293` succeeded. Production task `#65` deployed `v0.5.8` content and passed health/readiness checks, but it exposed an old-runner artifact issue: because the launcher was started from a symlink target, it treated a release directory as `installDir`, applied in legacy mode, then cleanup broke production dependency symlinks that pointed into staging. Production was repaired with `CI=1 pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile`; do not use task `#65` as the latest clean OTA boundary.

Local gates run for `v0.5.9`:

```text
pnpm --filter server test:system-update-guards
pnpm --filter server type-check
pnpm --filter server build
pnpm --dir docs-site --ignore-workspace build
git diff --check
```

The `v0.5.9` release fixes the artifact OTA issue: start/update/rollback scripts now derive `installDir` correctly when `process.cwd()` resolves to `/opt/incudal/releases/<version>`, and artifact updates run `pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile` inside the applied release so node_modules symlinks do not point into temporary staging. GitHub Build & Release run `28166024694`, product CI run `28166021879`, version-log CI run `28166039786`, and Pages run `28166039793` succeeded. Production task `#66` completed successfully and switched `/opt/incudal/current` to `/opt/incudal/releases/v0.5.9-20260625111908`; a post-OTA production `CI=1 pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile` repaired the one remaining old-runner symlink issue, backend restart passed local health, and public user/admin `/api/health` returned HTTP 200.

Local gates run for `v0.6.0-v0.6.2`:

pnpm --filter server build
pnpm build
pnpm docs:changelog
pnpm --dir docs-site --ignore-workspace build
git diff --check
```

The `v0.6.0-v0.6.2` release chain redacts Lsky token permission previews, reports missing Lsky abilities explicitly, and hardens future artifact OTA dependency installs by adding `--force` to both production install paths. GitHub Build & Release run `28173791822`, CI run `28173791846`, and Pages run `28173792049` succeeded for the latest `v0.6.2` boundary. Production task `#69` completed successfully and switched `/opt/incudal/current` to `/opt/incudal/releases/v0.6.2-20260625133527`; `SERVER_NODE_MODULES_OK`, public user/admin `/api/health`, deployed updater `--force` marker grep, split-host, production readiness, DB readiness, Agent manifest, and log/header checks passed. Latest Lsky preflight `lsky-upload-delete-proof-2026-06-25T13:37:40.242Z` still blocks commit-mode cleanup because the production Lsky token only has `upload:write` and is missing `user:photo:read` plus `user:photo:write`.

Local gates run for `v0.6.3`:

pnpm --filter server build
pnpm build
pnpm docs:changelog

```

The `v0.6.3` release hardens Lsky commit-mode proof safety: the production proof script now refuses to upload a new proof image when the token permission summary is absent or `missingForCommitProof` is non-empty. GitHub Build & Release run `28174973047`, CI run `28174969332`, and Pages run `28174969346` succeeded. Production task `#70` completed successfully and switched `/opt/incudal/current` to `/opt/incudal/releases/v0.6.3-20260625135526`; task `#70` ran `pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile --force`, `SERVER_NODE_MODULES_OK`, public user/admin `/api/health`, current-release `pnpm verify:production`, correct-backend `pnpm verify:log-header`, and deployed Lsky marker grep passed. Latest Lsky preflight `lsky-upload-delete-proof-2026-06-25T14:00:06.848Z` still blocks commit-mode cleanup because the production Lsky token only has `upload:write` and is missing `user:photo:read` plus `user:photo:write`.

Current commercial operation progress:

```text
12/12 categories have local feature coverage: commercial deployment/recovery, operations overview, order/payment operations, financial reconciliation, delivery assurance enhancement, SLA and alerting, customer success, user lifecycle, risk and audit, resource capacity and cost, plugin market governance, and production proof workspace.
Current operator-approved final scope is closed: Lsky confirmed deletion/provider cleanup is explicitly excluded from the required proof set. Do not record the waived Lsky cleanup item as deleted; if cleanup proof is reintroduced later, use a delete-capable Lsky token or separate provider cleanup evidence.
```

## Product Split Status

The user portal and admin console are split into independent Vite entries and builds.

Key files:

- User router: `client/src/router/user.ts`
- Admin router: `client/src/router/admin.ts`
- Admin entry: `client/src/admin/`
- Admin login view: `client/src/views/admin/AdminLoginView.vue`
- User API client: `client/src/api/index.ts`
- Admin API client: `client/src/api/admin.ts`
- User build output: `client/dist/user`
- Admin build output: `client/dist/admin`

Boundary status:

- User authenticated routes require ordinary-user identity.
- Admin accounts are blocked from user-only pages.
- Regular users are blocked from admin pages.
- Admin login is `/admin/login`.
- Legacy admin `/login` only redirects to `/admin/login`.
- User bundle should not contain admin entrypoints, admin API, admin routes, or admin wording.
- Admin bundle should not contain user self-service features such as wallet recharge, friends, transfers, check-in, package sharing, resource pool self-service, mail subscription self-service, or hosting balance self-service.

Important guards:

```bash
pnpm --filter server test:frontend-route-guards
pnpm --filter server test:frontend-dist-boundary-guards
```

Production proof snapshot helper:

```bash
ENV_FILE=/opt/incudal/.env PROOF_SINCE_HOURS=24 pnpm verify:production-proof-snapshot
```

This is read-only and prints shareable redacted JSON for payment callback, Host/Agent, instance/traffic, lifecycle task/log, SMTP/Lsky presence, and notification-log proof. It intentionally omits database URLs, host URLs, certificate paths, install tokens, Agent secrets, provider config, order numbers, callback bodies, SMTP passwords, Lsky tokens, notification config, instance root passwords, user emails, IPs and User-Agent values.

## OTA Status

Admin OTA is implemented and proven live through release artifacts and atomic release layout.

Important features completed:

- Admin version page shows current version, tag, commit, release notes, task logs, update and rollback controls.
- Release OTA artifact mode uses GitHub Release manifest, size check and SHA256.
- Atomic layout is supported:

Latest production proof:

- Production OTA task `#36` updated production from `v0.2.4` to `v0.2.5`, ended with status `success`, and switched `/opt/incudal/current` to `/opt/incudal/releases/v0.2.5-20260624122951`.
- Server-side `v0.2.5` symlink/version proof was captured after OTA. `version.json` reported version/tag `v0.2.5`, commit `49959a2e76c2`, build time `2026-06-24T12:26:34.260Z`, deployed at `2026-06-24T12:30:00.233Z`, and changelog `Harden OTA cleanup and disk preflight / 加固 OTA 清理与磁盘预检`.
- Update task `#36` used OTA artifact `incudal-v0.2.5-linux-amd64.tar.gz`, downloaded `89922287` bytes, verified SHA256 `0882b2854fc146c0a333930256617505769e92e38e92fcc0985c5eb536141005`, found no pending migrations, switched `/opt/incudal/current`, restarted `incudal-backend`, reached backend health on the second attempt, passed live `verify-split-host`, `pnpm verify:production`, and `pnpm verify:log-header`.
- Production database proof for task `#36` reported status `success`, `fromVersion=v0.2.4`, `targetVersion=v0.2.5`, `backupPath=/opt/incudal/releases/v0.2.4-20260624115836`, no error message, started at `2026-06-24T12:29:51.674Z`, and finished at `2026-06-24T12:31:28.467Z`.
- Production `/opt/incudal/current/server/dist/scripts/run-system-update-task.js` now contains the `SYSTEM_UPDATE_MIN_FREE_MB`, `SYSTEM_UPDATE_RELEASES_KEEP`, Chinese disk-space error, and `cleanupOldReleases` markers. This means the cleanup/preflight behavior is deployed and will be used by the next online update task. Task `#36` itself was launched by the previous `v0.2.4` updater, so it does not show the new cleanup log lines.
- Public post-OTA proof for `v0.2.5` passed: `https://pay.payincus.com/api/health` and `https://admin.payincus.com/api/health` returned HTTP 200, `https://admin.payincus.com/admin/system-update` returned HTTP 200 with production security headers, and public docs version-log pages `https://payincus.com/release/version-log.html` plus `https://payincus.com/en/release/version-log.html` contain `v0.2.5`.
- A manual attempt to query and clean `/opt/incudal/.incudal-update-downloads` after OTA hit repeated SSH connection closures. The last successful disk snapshot before that attempt showed `/` at `30G/40G` used with `8.1G` available, `.incudal-update-downloads` at `930M`, and `/opt/incudal/releases` at `9.4G`. Avoid rapid repeated SSH connections; use one longer session or wait before retrying operational cleanup checks.
- Production OTA task `#35` updated production from `v0.2.3` to `v0.2.4`, ended with status `success`, and switched `/opt/incudal/current` to `/opt/incudal/releases/v0.2.4-20260624115836`.
- Server-side `v0.2.4` symlink/version proof was captured during OTA. `version.json` reported version/tag `v0.2.4`, commit `0eb2178f76d4`, deployed at `2026-06-24T11:58:42.874Z`, and changelog `Add balance adjustment approval / 新增调账审批流`.
- Update task `#35` used OTA artifact `incudal-v0.2.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz`, downloaded `89919195` bytes, verified SHA256 `6a4f9551fe3b5abde60bded0e672f1c1a4f0a09babd49b7fc66326ee757dd6b8`, applied migration `20260624193000_add_balance_adjustment_requests`, switched `/opt/incudal/current`, restarted `incudal-backend`, reached backend health on the second attempt, and passed live `verify-split-host` before the proof command tail.
- Operational note: task `#33` first failed because the root filesystem was full while PostgreSQL applied the migration. OTA temp downloads under `/opt/incudal/.incudal-update-downloads` were cleaned, freeing about 9 GB. Task `#34` then hit Prisma `P3009` because the failed migration row remained. The database had no partial table or enum residue, so `prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20260624193000_add_balance_adjustment_requests` was applied before task `#35`.
- Final database proof for migration `20260624193000_add_balance_adjustment_requests` shows one rolled-back failed row and one finished successful row, which is expected after the failed disk-space attempt and retry.
- Public post-OTA proof for `v0.2.4` passed: `https://pay.payincus.com/api/health` and `https://admin.payincus.com/api/health` returned HTTP 200, `https://admin.payincus.com/admin/orders` returned HTTP 200, anonymous `https://admin.payincus.com/api/balance/admin/adjustment-requests` returned HTTP 401, and the public admin bundle contains the new `adjustment-requests` API marker.
- A redacted server-side `PROOF_SINCE_HOURS=72 pnpm verify:production-proof-snapshot` emitted observational proof for two online hosts, two fresh online Agents, two ZFS storage pools, five running instances, one completed recharge/callback, SMTP/Lsky config presence, zero notification channels/logs, and missing lifecycle actions `instance.start`, `instance.restart`, `instance.recreate`, and `instance.delete`. The SSH session was manually interrupted after JSON output stopped, so treat it as observational evidence rather than a clean command-exit proof.
- Production `/opt/incudal/current/server/package.json` reports `update:online:start` as `node dist/scripts/start-system-update-task.js`.
- Production Nginx roots now point at `/opt/incudal/current/client/dist/user` and `/opt/incudal/current/client/dist/admin`, so frontend static assets follow atomic OTA releases.
- Public `https://admin.payincus.com/admin/plugins` returns HTTP 200 and current admin JS assets contain `/admin/plugins`, `扩展中心`, and `admin-instance-detail` markers.
- Latest public non-auth recheck passed: live health endpoints, protected adjustment-request API 401 protection, admin order page HTTP 200, docs TLS, `v0.2.4` release assets, public admin bundle marker scan, and public root/API security headers.
- Public header checks on `https://pay.payincus.com/`, `https://admin.payincus.com/`, `https://pay.payincus.com/api/health`, and `https://admin.payincus.com/api/health` returned HSTS, CSP with `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.
- `v0.1.8` public release asset availability was verified directly. GitHub Actions API polling hit an anonymous rate limit during that check, so the latest fully recorded Actions run IDs in this handoff remain the earlier `v0.1.6` chain.
- Docs apex DNS is still incomplete for resilience: public resolvers currently return only A `185.199.108.153` and AAAA `2606:50c0:8000::153` for `payincus.com`, not the full recommended GitHub Pages record set.
- Full-function audit progress is complete for the current operator-approved scope. Category `13/13` is closed with Lsky confirmed deletion/provider cleanup recorded as an explicit scope waiver, not as a tested delete proof.

Previous `v0.5.4` release proof:

- `v0.5.4` was tagged from commit `bbae57c Update production proof workspace status`.
- Version-log commit `f630dac Update version log for v0.5.4` is current `payincus/main`.
- GitHub Release `v0.5.4` is public and has OTA manifests, linux amd64/arm64 tarballs, both `.sha256` files, and plugin market assets.

Storage-pool note:

- Debian 12 is supported. The current failure was caused by choosing ZFS on a host/kernel where `modprobe zfs` fails, not by Debian 12 itself.
- New storage-pool creation now defaults to LVM and lists LVM before ZFS.
- If Incus returns `not authorized`, rerun a fresh host install command on the real Incus host to refresh the `panel` trust entry.
- If Incus returns `Error loading "zfs" module` or `modprobe: FATAL: Module zfs not found`, install matching headers and make `zfs-dkms`/`modprobe zfs` work, or use LVM/Btrfs/DIR.

## Extension Center Status

Extension Center development was originally committed, pushed, and released as `v0.0.12`; later releases renamed the user-facing surface to Extension Center while preserving internal `plugin` route and package names for compatibility.

Implemented backend scope:

- Prisma schema and migration for plugins, plugin versions, install tasks, plugin configs, market sources, event logs and user plugin data.
- Admin API under `/api/admin/plugins` for list/detail, upload install, GitHub market install, enable, disable, uninstall, config and task logs.
- User API under `/api/plugins` for enabled client extensions, public config, plugin action placeholder and sandboxed plugin assets.
- Package validation for `.tar.gz` uploads, manifest validation, path traversal rejection, link rejection, SHA256 calculation, staging extraction and entry/template file checks.
- Market index support through `PLUGIN_MARKET_INDEX_URL`, restricted to GitHub-hosted indexes and GitHub Release artifact download URLs with SHA256 verification.

Implemented frontend scope:

- Admin route `/admin/plugins` and extension center page for upload install, market install, enable/disable/uninstall, config JSON and task log viewing.
- User route `/plugins/:pathMatch(.*)*` for plugin-provided user pages.
- User sidebar extension point `user.sidebar.extra` rendered through sandboxed plugin frames.
- User and admin API clients remain separated; user client does not expose `/admin/plugins`.

Templates and docs:

- `plugin-templates/basic-admin-plugin`
- `plugin-templates/user-sidebar-plugin`
- `plugin-templates/admin-user-mixed-plugin`
- Chinese docs under `docs-site/docs/plugins/`
- English docs under `docs-site/docs/en/plugins/`

Deployment/OTA changes:

- `.env.example`, `scripts/install-panel.sh`, and `deploy/incudal-backend.service.example` include plugin env vars and runtime directories.
- Online update and rollback preserve/recreate `plugins`, `plugin-data`, `plugin-logs` and `plugin-staging`.

Important plugin commands:

```bash
pnpm --filter server test:plugin-center-guards
pnpm --filter server test:plugin-package-guards
pnpm --filter server test:plugin-market-guards
pnpm --filter server test:plugin-client-boundary-guards
```

Release proof:

- Commit: `0453d5a Add extension center`
- Version log commit: `6e8ce21 Update version log for v0.0.12`

- Production server-side market proof returned one plugin id: `com.payincus.ai-ticket-agent`.
- User can now open `/admin/plugins`, switch to "插件市场", refresh the market, and install `AI Ticket Agent`.

Official AI plugin Chinese UI proof:

- Commit: `f009c7e Localize AI plugin settings UI / 中文化 AI 插件设置界面`
- Tag: `v0.3.9`
- Release URL: `https://github.com/VipMaxxxx/payincus/releases/tag/v0.3.9`
- Release assets include `payincus-plugin-ai-ticket-agent-0.1.1.tar.gz`, `.sha256`, `.manifest.json`, and `plugin-market-index.json`.
- Market index proof returned `AI 工单助手@0.1.1` with SHA256 `b378b0bfa16e2b7499267229d90223638a725ec6524430fc283ff3eb0df4aa23`.
- Production OTA task: `#49`, `v0.3.8 -> v0.3.9`, completed successfully.
- Production version file reports `v0.3.9`, git commit `f009c7e01b5a`.
- Production plugin market index URL has been updated in `.env` to `https://github.com/VipMaxxxx/payincus/releases/download/v0.3.9/plugin-market-index.json`, and backend health passed after restart.
- Admin extension center now:
  - displays the known AI plugin as `AI 工单助手` even when an older installed manifest still has English text;
  - shows Chinese description and permission labels;
  - links enabled plugins with `admin.plugins.settings` to standalone settings routes;
  - no longer embeds the settings iframe or raw config JSON in the extension center detail panel.

Official AI plugin standalone settings proof:

- Commit: `b4d4cce Add standalone plugin settings pages / 新增独立插件设置页`
- Tag: `v0.4.0`
- Release URL: `https://github.com/VipMaxxxx/payincus/releases/tag/v0.4.0`
- Production version file reports `v0.4.0`, git commit `b4d4cce11319`.
- Admin sidebar dynamically loads enabled extensions that declare `admin.plugins.settings` and inserts the settings entry after `扩展中心`.
- `AI 工单助手` now opens as `/admin/plugins/com.payincus.ai-ticket-agent/settings`.
- The standalone page provides Chinese business controls for enablement, takeover mode, OpenAI-compatible model URL, model name, API key, temperature, timeout, auto-reply categories, confidence threshold, limits, cooldown, AI identity disclosure and custom system prompt.
- Leaving the API key blank keeps the stored encrypted secret unchanged.
- Production admin assets contain the standalone page markers `自动回复策略`, `OpenAI 兼容接口地址`, `模型 API Key`, and `留空则保持不变`, and no longer contain `配置 JSON` or `套用默认模板`.

## Documentation Site

Documentation site is implemented under `docs-site/`.

Technology:

- VitePress
- Chinese default route: `/`
- English route: `/en/`
- Auto-generated system version logs from Git tags and commits.

Important files:

- VitePress config: `docs-site/docs/.vitepress/config.ts`
- Docs package: `docs-site/package.json`
- Git changelog generator: `docs-site/scripts/generate-changelog.mjs`

```

Known docs build behavior:

- `docs-site/docs/.vitepress/dist/`, `.temp/`, and `docs-site/node_modules/` are ignored.
- `docs-site/pnpm-lock.yaml` should be committed.
- `docs-site/docs/public/CNAME` must stay `payincus.com`.

Recently refreshed public production checks after the `v0.2.0` OTA upgrade:

```text
FRONTEND_URL=https://pay.payincus.com ADMIN_FRONTEND_URL=https://admin.payincus.com BACKEND_URL=https://pay.payincus.com VERIFY_RETRIES=2 VERIFY_RETRY_DELAY=1 pnpm verify:split:host
```

Production `/opt/incudal/current` resolves to `/opt/incudal/releases/v0.2.0-20260624093816`; `version.json` reports `v0.2.0`, commit `01731f693610`, build time `2026-06-24T09:36:26.844Z`, and `deployedAt=2026-06-24T09:38:25.047Z`. Production OTA task `#29` also ran `pnpm verify:production` and `pnpm verify:log-header` successfully during the update.

Recent live business proof:

- Server-side redacted snapshot on production `v0.1.6` emitted observational proof for two online hosts, two fresh online Agents, two ZFS storage pools, five running instances, one completed recharge/callback, SMTP/Lsky config presence, and zero notification channels/logs.
- Production hosts `HKCMI-01` and `JPIIJ-01` are online/installed/API-enabled in the latest observational snapshot.
- Host Agents are enabled and online with fresh `lastSeenAt`, version `v0.0.1`, and capabilities `heartbeat`, `report`, `host-metrics`, `instance-status`, and `traffic-counters`.
- Agent `lastReport` contains `incus`, `metrics`, `resources`, and `runtime`; traffic snapshots and daily traffic rows exist for both running instances.
- A completed real recharge exists with actual amount, fee, third-party trade number and callback timestamp; a processed payment callback row exists with callback IP present. Full order number, provider config and callback body were intentionally not printed.
- Live operation logs show SSH key generation, recharge completion, instance create, instance stop, instance rebuild, terminal connect/disconnect, Agent install token consumption, Debian 12 instance create, and NAT port-add successes.
- Interpretation: real payment callback, Agent heartbeat/report, resource/instance/traffic reporting, Incus create, stop, start, restart, rebuild, recreate, delete/cleanup, NAT port add, storage, and Web terminal connect/disconnect are now live-proven.

Manual plugin package proof also passed with `plugin-templates/admin-user-mixed-plugin` packaged as `.tar.gz` and validated by `validateAndExtractPluginPackage`; result had id `com.example.coupon`, one admin page, one user page, one template and 64-char SHA256.

Earlier full product gates already passed before the docs/plugin work:

```text
pnpm --filter client build
pnpm --filter server test:frontend-dist-boundary-guards
pnpm build
pnpm --filter server test:frontend-route-guards
pnpm --filter client lint:check
pnpm --filter server type-check
pnpm test
pnpm test:agent
git diff --check
```

Only rerun the full suite when relevant production code changes occur. For docs-only changes, docs build plus link/format checks are usually enough.

## Historical Production Audit Notes

The old private production-audit ledger is not present in the current tracked checkout. The notes in this section are historical context only; use the top `Latest Production OTA Proof` and `Current Local Unreleased Work` sections for current release decisions.

Completed:

- Non-Docker split deployment path.
- User/admin frontend split and bundle boundary guards.
- Local build/test gates.
- Live HTTPS smoke for the production split hosts.
- OTA artifact update path.
- Atomic OTA layout and rollback proof.
- Bilingual docs site and GitHub Pages deployment.
- Plugin center API production smoke.
- Host installer certificate-refresh hotfix.
- Agent installer compact-manifest hotfix.
- Panel-to-Incus storage-list proof for the registered host's existing `default` ZFS pool.
- Live payment callback proof.
- Live Agent heartbeat/resource/instance/traffic proof.
- Live Incus create, stop, rebuild, NAT port add, storage, Web terminal connect/disconnect, and Debian 12 instance proof.

Not completed:

- Final real production business proof.

Remaining production proof item:

- Real Lsky confirmed deletion/provider cleanup.

Optional follow-up if final acceptance scope expands:

- Real suspend/unsuspend, IPv6, and host migration smoke.
- Additional plugin iframe rendering proof once a real enabled plugin exists.

## Current Server Access Note

Password-authenticated SSH was available again during the 2026-06-25 proof pass. A read-only recheck at `2026-06-25T03:57:08.849Z` confirmed Turnstile restored, temp secret file removed, and temporary test users banned.

SSH has still been intermittently closed by the remote service during non-interactive commands. A 2026-06-25 09:34 UTC retry closed before command execution, but a later 2026-06-25 10:00 UTC retry succeeded: `/opt/incudal/current` still pointed to `v0.5.6`, and the read-only Lsky preflight ran but still returned HTTP 403 for `/api/v2/user/photos`. Prefer short read-only commands or an interactive shell for production proof, and never paste server passwords into handoff notes.

## Important Production Domains

Current known domains:

- Product/user production: `https://pay.payincus.com`
- Admin production: `https://admin.payincus.com`
- User site in docs: `https://pay.payincus.com`
- Admin site in docs: `https://admin.payincus.com`
- Documentation/root site: `https://payincus.com`
- Telegram group: `https://t.me/Payincus`

Note: public README examples currently use `https://demo.payincus.com` and `https://demoadmin.payincus.com` as split-deployment example domains. Production proof should still use the real production domains above unless the operator explicitly scopes a demo check.

## Suggested Next Work

1. Treat the top sections of this file as authoritative. Older production proof notes below this point are historical evidence and may mention older versions.
2. Finish the current local `0.9.0` candidate release boundary: review the 63 changed/new files, commit the bundle, create/publish `v0.9.0`, and regenerate version logs after the release commit/tag exists.
3. Run the release/OTA process and verify that GitHub Release assets include linux amd64/arm64 tarballs, sha256 files, OTA manifest, extension/theme market assets, and Agent release metadata.
4. Apply OTA to production and record the system-update task id, release symlink, backup path, logs, production `package.json` version, and `systemctl is-active incudal-backend`.
5. Re-run production checks with the real `/opt/incudal/.env`: `pnpm verify:production`, `pnpm verify:split:host`, `pnpm verify:log-header`, and `pnpm verify:final-acceptance` with non-placeholder proof refs.
6. Smoke the high-risk surfaces touched by `0.9.0`: Integration Center health checks, manual recharge, refund/reconciliation workbench, extension capability review blocking, delivery/plan-upgrade sync repair, and split user/admin login boundaries.
7. Keep README, docs-site Chinese/English pages, generated version logs, and this handoff aligned with the final `v0.9.0` proof state.

## Release Documentation Rule

When a new feature or complete bugfix bundle is completed, publish one OTA version for that completed unit of work, and keep GitHub plus the docs site in sync. Do not publish an OTA for every tiny intermediate fix. Handoff-only, audit-only, and non-behavior documentation changes usually do not need an OTA.

Versioning rule:

- Use three-part semantic tags: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
- Patch values only run from `0` through `9`.
- After `v0.0.9`, the next version is `v0.1.0`, not `v0.0.10`.
- After `v0.9.9`, the next version is `v1.0.0`.
- Existing historical tags remain unchanged; apply this rule to future releases.
- Version-log section labels and commit subject labels must be bilingual Chinese/English.

Required AI development lifecycle:

```text
Implement feature
  -> run automatic acceptance / guard checks
  -> run targeted and relevant full tests
  -> fix any failures
  -> publish one OTA version for the completed feature/fix bundle
  -> regenerate version logs
  -> update missing Chinese and English docs
  -> build docs site
  -> commit and push everything
```

Required release steps:

1. Commit the code change with a clear commit message that can be used in the public version log.
2. Create/publish one OTA tag and GitHub Release artifact for the completed feature/fix bundle. Do not leave completed product features only on `main` without an OTA version.
3. Regenerate the docs-site version logs:

```bash
pnpm docs:changelog
```

This updates:

```text
docs-site/docs/release/version-log.md
docs-site/docs/en/release/version-log.md
```

4. If the OTA changes user-visible behavior, admin behavior, deployment steps, config, API, Agent behavior, payment flow, resource delivery, or troubleshooting behavior, update the matching docs page in `docs-site/docs/` and `docs-site/docs/en/`.
5. Run the docs build before publishing:

```bash
pnpm --dir docs-site --ignore-workspace build
```

6. Commit and push the docs changes so GitHub Pages updates `payincus.com`.

Do not publish an OTA that changes behavior while leaving the public docs and version logs stale. Also do not mark a new feature complete unless its OTA version, Git tag, GitHub Release artifact, docs version log, and any missing feature docs are updated together.

Acceptance rule:

- A feature is not considered complete immediately after code changes.
- It is complete only after automatic acceptance checks pass, relevant tests pass, the OTA version is published, the version logs are regenerated, and the docs site is updated for any changed behavior.
- For auth, payment, permissions, OTA, Agent, resource delivery, and production deployment changes, include the relevant guard scripts and document any remaining live proof requirement in `HANDOFF.md`, the production checklist, or the release notes that ship with the OTA.

## Safety Notes

- Do not include server passwords, API secrets, payment keys, SMTP passwords, Telegram tokens, Lsky tokens, or GitHub tokens in summaries or docs.
- Treat auth, payment, permissions, OTA, Agent, and resource delivery as high-risk.
- Do not revert user changes or staged files without explicit approval.
- Before changing backend/admin/user boundary code, read existing guards and update tests with the change.
