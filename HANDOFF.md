# PayIncus Handoff

Last updated: 2026-06-27 CST

This file is a handoff note for a new Codex conversation. Do not include server passwords or other secrets in this file.

## Repository

- Local path: `/Users/max/Documents/incudal`
- Main product repository: `git@github.com:VipMaxxxx/payincus.git`
- Current local branch: `master`
- Target remote branch: `payincus/main`
- Repository history: default branch was rebuilt as an independent PayIncus baseline on 2026-06-27; a local mirror backup was kept for private audit traceability.
- Important ledger: `docs/production-audit.md`
- Commercial operation task ledger: `docs/commercial-operation-task-goals.md`

## Current Git State

Use `git log --oneline --decorate -5` as the authoritative current HEAD because this handoff may receive handoff-only commits after product releases. The latest product/docs release baseline at the time of this refresh was:

```text
8df3634 Fix instance plan upgrade capacity checks
```

GitHub remote `payincus/main` was aligned after the handoff refresh commits.

The tracked tree should be clean against `payincus/main` after pulling. The local audit ledger under `docs/production-audit.md` is ignored by git and may contain newer operational notes.

Latest tracked repository commit at the time of this refresh:

```text
1ab2452 Update version log for v0.8.7
```

## Latest Production OTA Proof

- Production version: `v0.8.7`
- Release tag commit: `8df36349327b`
- Current production symlink: `/opt/incudal/current -> /opt/incudal/releases/v0.8.7-20260627054123`
- OTA task: `91`, status `success`, completed at `2026-06-27T05:42:54Z`.
- GitHub Actions: `Build & Release` for `v0.8.7` succeeded, `CI` on `main` succeeded, docs Pages deployment succeeded.
- Release assets verified: linux amd64/arm64 tarballs, sha256 files, OTA manifest, and marketplace assets.
- Production checks passed during OTA: split host verification, `pnpm verify:production`, `pnpm verify:log-header`.
- Independent checks after OTA:
  - `https://pay.payincus.com/api/health` returned HTTP 200.
  - `https://admin.payincus.com/api/health` returned HTTP 200.
  - `https://admin.payincus.com/api/admin/instances/1/available-plans` returned HTTP 401 without auth.
  - `https://pay.payincus.com/api/instances/1/change-plan/preview?newPlanId=1` returned HTTP 401 without auth.
  - Production server dist contains `reservePlanUpgradeCapacityWithLock`, `HOST_RESOURCES_INSUFFICIENT`, and the instance upgrade bandwidth restore call.
  - Production user/admin assets contain the capacity warning text `实例所在节点资源不足`.
  - `systemctl is-active incudal-backend` returned `active`.

## Latest Instance Upgrade Work

`v0.8.7` fixed paid instance plan upgrade resource and bandwidth consistency:

- User-side and admin-side plan upgrades now perform host capacity checks against the instance's current host before charging or updating the instance.
- Upgrade capacity checks use the resource delta between the current instance and target plan, then lock the host row with `FOR UPDATE` during the transaction to prevent concurrent over-allocation.
- CPU, memory, and disk are all checked; disk capacity now also participates in available-host filtering for new purchases.
- Plan upgrade transactions update host usage counters from projected aggregate usage, avoiding the previous post-upgrade counter increment pattern.
- Upgrades now update `limitsIngress` and `limitsEgress` in the database and call Incus bandwidth restore so the displayed bandwidth and actual instance bandwidth are aligned.
- User preview and admin upgrade plan lists expose `resourceCapacity` / `resourceWarnings`; unavailable upgrade targets are disabled in the admin modal.
- New guard coverage: `pnpm --filter server test:plan-upgrade-capacity-guards`.

## Latest Resource Risk Work

`v0.8.4` added the instance-scoped resource risk center:

- Collects bandwidth Mbps, PPS, packet deltas, and CPU usage samples from Incus traffic polling.
- Scores instances only; accounts are linked through the source instance and can be restricted from new orders/requires manual ticket review.
- Supports QoS tiers from the admin policy page, defaulting to 50 Mbps, 30 Mbps, and 10 Mbps thresholds.
- Supports CPU sustained usage, sustained bandwidth, packet anomaly, and small-packet scan suspicion signals.
- Supports automatic instance suspension when `autoSuspendEnabled` is enabled and score reaches `autoSuspendScore`; default is currently disabled to avoid first-rollout false positives.
- Adds user review ticket flow when `ORDER_RESTRICTED_BY_RISK` blocks instance creation.

`v0.8.5` hardened OTA:

- The OTA runner now explicitly runs `pnpm --filter server exec prisma generate` after `prisma migrate deploy` in artifact atomic, artifact legacy, and git fallback update paths.
- `server/scripts/test-resource-risk-guards.ts` now checks the key risk policy fields and auto-suspend/order-restrict service wiring.

`v0.8.6` added manual resource risk controls:

- Resource risk policy QoS tiers now use structured numeric rows instead of a CSV textarea; each row has level, bandwidth Mbps, and trigger score.
- Admins can manually limit a risky instance's bandwidth and optionally restrict the linked account from new orders.
- Admins can manually suspend or unsuspend an instance from the resource risk center; manual suspension writes risk events, updates the instance state, and can notify the user.
- Admins can manually restrict the linked account from ordering when a specific instance needs ticket review.
- Backend validation rejects invalid QoS tiers, invalid scores, missing manual reasons, and invalid manual bandwidth values.

Production warnings observed during `pnpm verify:production`:

```text
PAYMENT_CALLBACK_IP_WHITELIST is empty; provider-specific defaults apply only where the backend implements them.
Public package #1 (HKCMI) is active but online bound hosts cannot satisfy its minimum CPU/memory requirement.
```

These are existing operational warnings and did not block the `v0.8.1` OTA.

Important release-chain note:

```text
v0.6.7 contained the extension platform and theme system feature bundle, but its Release failed on the frontend route guard and must not be used for OTA.
v0.6.8 fixed the extension platform release guards and deployed successfully through production task #74.
v0.6.9 fixed the public extension/theme market domain to payincus.com.
v0.6.10 adds the guarded gift card center.
v0.6.11 adds the guarded operations settings center.
v0.6.12 fixes admin gift card generation being blocked by the Turnstile gate.
v0.6.13 adds the visible user gift-card Turnstile verification page.
v0.6.14 fixes reliable user gift-card Turnstile token submission and redeemed-card list visibility.
v0.6.15 persists expired gift-card status outside the rolled-back error path.
v0.6.16 fixes gift-card user Turnstile body-token verification by moving the check after body parsing.
v0.6.17 polishes public/user/admin UI structure, help search, gift-card safety UI, Extension Center tab routing, docs, and guard coverage.
v0.6.18 includes the instance card and auto-name feature commit but its Release failed on frontend boundary guard and must not be used for OTA.
v0.6.19 fixes the instance transfer path boundary guard and was the previous production boundary.
v0.8.1 hardens storage pool sellability/creation guards, fixes loop storage source handling, adds user self-service instance traffic reset, and is the current production boundary.

Post-update checks:

```text
The admin console contains a read-only Production Proof workspace at /admin/production-proof.
The user build output does not contain the production-proof route, nav key, or page content.
Production `v0.6.6` is live after the final-proof scope waiver release and artifact-mode live-acceptance fix. Current proof progress is complete for the operator-approved scope: 12 proof items are verified, and Lsky confirmed deletion/provider cleanup is explicitly waived by the operator rather than tested.
Latest OTA proof: task `#73` updated `v0.6.5 -> v0.6.6`, switched `/opt/incudal/current` to `/opt/incudal/releases/v0.6.6-20260625151558`, and finished with `System update completed successfully`. Manual current-release checks confirmed version `v0.6.6`, commit `9fcbe2867efa`, backend `active`, `SERVER_NODE_MODULES_OK`, `pnpm verify:production`, and `pnpm verify:log-header`.
Final live acceptance report: `/tmp/incudal-proof/final-acceptance-v0.6.6.md` ended with `final_go_status: live_proof_references_documented` and `status: automated_checks_completed`. In artifact mode, `agent_release_smoke` is recorded as skipped because production preflight verifies the Agent manifest; this avoids the old `tsx` dev-dependency failure in production artifacts.
Production `v0.5.3` showed the production DB backup/restore drill as verified in the read-only proof workspace and is now an older rollback release.
Production Lsky proof script is deployed at `server/dist/scripts/lsky-production-proof.js`. Latest read-only proof `lsky-upload-delete-proof-2026-06-25T14:33:18.929Z` confirmed config present, API v2 host `kkksr.com`, group endpoint HTTP 200, token permission endpoint HTTP 200 with redacted summary output, token abilities only include `upload:write`, missing `user:photo:read` and `user:photo:write`, and `/api/v2/user/photos?page=1&per_page=1` returned HTTP 403. Commit mode was not run. The operator then explicitly said this cleanup proof does not need testing, so record it as a scope waiver and never as confirmed deletion.
Official Lsky Pro+ API docs confirm `DELETE /api/v2/user/photos` expects a JSON numeric ID array and returns HTTP 204 on successful deletion. The current production code matches this endpoint/body shape. A later production DB-only known-ID search `lsky-db-known-id-readonly-search-2026-06-25T04:54:26.080Z` found `attachmentCount=0` and no Lsky providerFileId in matched business log rows, so there is no safe persisted proof image ID to delete from the app side.
Current code review confirms there is no safe no-upload/no-known-ID deletion proof path: `deleteTicketImageFromLsky()` requires a numeric Lsky v2 provider ID before it sends `DELETE /api/v2/user/photos`, and the proof script refuses commit mode while `/api/v2/user/photos` returns HTTP 403. Do not probe production with guessed IDs, empty delete arrays, or invalid-ID delete requests.
Production DB backup/restore drill is proven through a temporary database restore and cleanup check.
Production Incus lifecycle is proven on dedicated test instance #9: stop task #5, start task #6, restart task #7, recreate task #8, delete cleanup, DB status deleted, Incus object not found, and host CPU/memory/disk resources returned to baseline.
Telegram delivery is proven by production bot message #339 to public group @Payincus.
Turnstile/session browser smoke is proven through the approved temporary disable-and-restore path: user /dashboard and admin /admin/production-proof rendered after login, config restored, temp secret file removed, and test users #31/#32 banned.
SMTP provider reference is proven by production send-test proof `smtp-provider-reference-2026-06-25T04:34:51.773Z`: recipient domain `qq.com`, provider reference `35bd2e0d-e817-1e31-ffde-de033e861c7e@qq.com`, accepted=1, rejected=0, pending=0, response `250 OK: queued as.`.
Remaining production proof for the current operator-approved scope is closed. Lsky confirmed deletion/provider cleanup is waived by operator decision, not tested. If this is later reintroduced, configure a delete-capable Lsky token with `user:photo:read` and `user:photo:write`, use a wildcard token, or perform provider-side cleanup before commit-mode proof; previous proof images may still need cleanup. Once that is available, run `LSKY_PROOF_COMMIT=1 ENV_FILE=/opt/incudal/.env NODE_ENV=production node server/dist/scripts/lsky-production-proof.js` and prove `DELETE /api/v2/user/photos` returns success/204 for its numeric provider ID.

The previous `v0.5.3` release chain was verified locally by the targeted guards, client/server build/type-check, docs version-log generation, docs build, diff hygiene, remote main/tag refs, public Release artifact availability, GitHub Build & Release/CI/Pages success, and production deployment/readiness proof. Final production acceptance still remains pending until the remaining real business proofs are captured.

```text
pnpm --filter server test:production-proof-center-guards
pnpm --filter client type-check
pnpm --filter client build

```

The latest release chain was refreshed for `v0.5.4`: GitHub Build & Release/CI/Pages succeeded, production OTA task `#61` completed successfully, public user/admin health checks passed, docs version-log pages contain `v0.5.4`, and server-side admin dist grep confirmed the live production-proof chunk contains the new `12/13` progress plus SMTP/Lsky remaining-proof wording.

```

The latest release chain was refreshed for `v0.5.6`: GitHub Build & Release/CI/Pages succeeded, production OTA task `#63` completed successfully after running the official updater runner manually, public user/admin health checks passed, docs version-log pages contain `v0.5.6`, and production now includes the repeatable read-only/commit-mode Lsky proof script. The script remains in read-only preflight mode by default and refuses commit-mode upload while the configured Lsky token cannot list user photos.

pnpm --dir docs-site --ignore-workspace build
git diff --check
```

The `v0.5.7` release hardens the online update/rollback runner environment: systemd update units now set a stable PATH, the runner checks required commands before mutating state, child processes inherit the stable PATH, ownership repair avoids shell interpolation, and artifact copies no longer depend on shell `cp -a`. Public Release assets and docs version-log proof passed. Production task `#64` completed successfully after running the official updater runner manually from the previous `v0.5.6` release; public health, production readiness, split-host, DB readiness, Agent manifest, log/header exposure, deployed runner markers and deployed systemd PATH template markers passed.

```

The `v0.5.8` release updated the read-only admin production-proof workspace to show SMTP as verified and the remaining proof count as `1`: only Lsky deletion/provider cleanup. GitHub Build & Release run `28164941815`, product CI run `28164938942`, version-log CI run `28164985317`, and Pages run `28164985293` succeeded. Production task `#65` deployed `v0.5.8` content and passed health/readiness checks, but it exposed an old-runner artifact issue: because the launcher was started from a symlink target, it treated a release directory as `installDir`, applied in legacy mode, then cleanup broke production dependency symlinks that pointed into staging. Production was repaired with `CI=1 pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile`; do not use task `#65` as the latest clean OTA boundary.

Local gates run for `v0.5.9`:

```text
pnpm --filter server test:system-update-guards
pnpm --filter server type-check
pnpm --filter server build
pnpm --dir docs-site --ignore-workspace build
git diff --check
```

The `v0.5.9` release fixes the artifact OTA issue: start/update/rollback scripts now derive `installDir` correctly when `process.cwd()` resolves to `/opt/incudal/releases/<version>`, and artifact updates run `pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile` inside the applied release so node_modules symlinks do not point into temporary staging. GitHub Build & Release run `28166024694`, product CI run `28166021879`, version-log CI run `28166039786`, and Pages run `28166039793` succeeded. Production task `#66` completed successfully and switched `/opt/incudal/current` to `/opt/incudal/releases/v0.5.9-20260625111908`; a post-OTA production `CI=1 pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile` repaired the one remaining old-runner symlink issue, backend restart passed local health, and public user/admin `/api/health` returned HTTP 200.

```

The `v0.6.0-v0.6.2` release chain redacts Lsky token permission previews, reports missing Lsky abilities explicitly, and hardens future artifact OTA dependency installs by adding `--force` to both production install paths. GitHub Build & Release run `28173791822`, CI run `28173791846`, and Pages run `28173792049` succeeded for the latest `v0.6.2` boundary. Production task `#69` completed successfully and switched `/opt/incudal/current` to `/opt/incudal/releases/v0.6.2-20260625133527`; `SERVER_NODE_MODULES_OK`, public user/admin `/api/health`, deployed updater `--force` marker grep, split-host, production readiness, DB readiness, Agent manifest, and log/header checks passed. Latest Lsky preflight `lsky-upload-delete-proof-2026-06-25T13:37:40.242Z` still blocks commit-mode cleanup because the production Lsky token only has `upload:write` and is missing `user:photo:read` plus `user:photo:write`.

```

The `v0.6.3` release hardens Lsky commit-mode proof safety: the production proof script now refuses to upload a new proof image when the token permission summary is absent or `missingForCommitProof` is non-empty. GitHub Build & Release run `28174973047`, CI run `28174969332`, and Pages run `28174969346` succeeded. Production task `#70` completed successfully and switched `/opt/incudal/current` to `/opt/incudal/releases/v0.6.3-20260625135526`; task `#70` ran `pnpm install --prod --frozen-lockfile --force`, `SERVER_NODE_MODULES_OK`, public user/admin `/api/health`, current-release `pnpm verify:production`, correct-backend `pnpm verify:log-header`, and deployed Lsky marker grep passed. Latest Lsky preflight `lsky-upload-delete-proof-2026-06-25T14:00:06.848Z` still blocks commit-mode cleanup because the production Lsky token only has `upload:write` and is missing `user:photo:read` plus `user:photo:write`.

Current commercial operation progress:

```text
12/12 categories have local feature coverage: commercial deployment/recovery, operations overview, order/payment operations, financial reconciliation, delivery assurance enhancement, SLA and alerting, customer success, user lifecycle, risk and audit, resource capacity and cost, plugin market governance, and production proof workspace.
Current operator-approved final scope is closed: Lsky confirmed deletion/provider cleanup is explicitly excluded from the required proof set. Do not record the waived Lsky cleanup item as deleted; if cleanup proof is reintroduced later, use a delete-capable Lsky token or separate provider cleanup evidence.
```

## Product Split Status

The user portal and admin console are split into independent Vite entries and builds.

Key files:

- User router: `client/src/router/user.ts`
- Admin router: `client/src/router/admin.ts`
- Admin entry: `client/src/admin/`
- Admin login view: `client/src/views/admin/AdminLoginView.vue`
- User API client: `client/src/api/index.ts`
- Admin API client: `client/src/api/admin.ts`
- User build output: `client/dist/user`
- Admin build output: `client/dist/admin`

Boundary status:

- User authenticated routes require ordinary-user identity.
- Admin accounts are blocked from user-only pages.
- Regular users are blocked from admin pages.
- Admin login is `/admin/login`.
- Legacy admin `/login` only redirects to `/admin/login`.
- User bundle should not contain admin entrypoints, admin API, admin routes, or admin wording.
- Admin bundle should not contain user self-service features such as wallet recharge, friends, transfers, check-in, package sharing, resource pool self-service, mail subscription self-service, or hosting balance self-service.

Important guards:

```bash
pnpm --filter server test:frontend-route-guards
pnpm --filter server test:frontend-dist-boundary-guards
```

Production proof snapshot helper:

```bash
ENV_FILE=/opt/incudal/.env PROOF_SINCE_HOURS=24 pnpm verify:production-proof-snapshot
```

This is read-only and prints shareable redacted JSON for payment callback, Host/Agent, instance/traffic, lifecycle task/log, SMTP/Lsky presence, and notification-log proof. It intentionally omits database URLs, host URLs, certificate paths, install tokens, Agent secrets, provider config, order numbers, callback bodies, SMTP passwords, Lsky tokens, notification config, instance root passwords, user emails, IPs and User-Agent values.

## OTA Status

Admin OTA is implemented and proven live through release artifacts and atomic release layout.

Important features completed:

- Admin version page shows current version, tag, commit, release notes, task logs, update and rollback controls.
- Release OTA artifact mode uses GitHub Release manifest, size check and SHA256.
- Atomic layout is supported:

```text
/opt/incudal/current -> /opt/incudal/releases/<version-timestamp>
/opt/incudal/releases/v0.0.10-...
/opt/incudal/releases/v0.0.11-...
```

Latest production proof:

- Production OTA task `#36` updated production from `v0.2.4` to `v0.2.5`, ended with status `success`, and switched `/opt/incudal/current` to `/opt/incudal/releases/v0.2.5-20260624122951`.
- Server-side `v0.2.5` symlink/version proof was captured after OTA. `version.json` reported version/tag `v0.2.5`, commit `49959a2e76c2`, build time `2026-06-24T12:26:34.260Z`, deployed at `2026-06-24T12:30:00.233Z`, and changelog `Harden OTA cleanup and disk preflight / 加固 OTA 清理与磁盘预检`.
- Update task `#36` used OTA artifact `incudal-v0.2.5-linux-amd64.tar.gz`, downloaded `89922287` bytes, verified SHA256 `0882b2854fc146c0a333930256617505769e92e38e92fcc0985c5eb536141005`, found no pending migrations, switched `/opt/incudal/current`, restarted `incudal-backend`, reached backend health on the second attempt, passed live `verify-split-host`, `pnpm verify:production`, and `pnpm verify:log-header`.
- Production database proof for task `#36` reported status `success`, `fromVersion=v0.2.4`, `targetVersion=v0.2.5`, `backupPath=/opt/incudal/releases/v0.2.4-20260624115836`, no error message, started at `2026-06-24T12:29:51.674Z`, and finished at `2026-06-24T12:31:28.467Z`.
- Production `/opt/incudal/current/server/dist/scripts/run-system-update-task.js` now contains the `SYSTEM_UPDATE_MIN_FREE_MB`, `SYSTEM_UPDATE_RELEASES_KEEP`, Chinese disk-space error, and `cleanupOldReleases` markers. This means the cleanup/preflight behavior is deployed and will be used by the next online update task. Task `#36` itself was launched by the previous `v0.2.4` updater, so it does not show the new cleanup log lines.
- Public post-OTA proof for `v0.2.5` passed: `https://pay.payincus.com/api/health` and `https://admin.payincus.com/api/health` returned HTTP 200, `https://admin.payincus.com/admin/system-update` returned HTTP 200 with production security headers, and public docs version-log pages `https://payincus.com/release/version-log.html` plus `https://payincus.com/en/release/version-log.html` contain `v0.2.5`.
- A manual attempt to query and clean `/opt/incudal/.incudal-update-downloads` after OTA hit repeated SSH connection closures. The last successful disk snapshot before that attempt showed `/` at `30G/40G` used with `8.1G` available, `.incudal-update-downloads` at `930M`, and `/opt/incudal/releases` at `9.4G`. Avoid rapid repeated SSH connections; use one longer session or wait before retrying operational cleanup checks.
- Production OTA task `#35` updated production from `v0.2.3` to `v0.2.4`, ended with status `success`, and switched `/opt/incudal/current` to `/opt/incudal/releases/v0.2.4-20260624115836`.
- Server-side `v0.2.4` symlink/version proof was captured during OTA. `version.json` reported version/tag `v0.2.4`, commit `0eb2178f76d4`, deployed at `2026-06-24T11:58:42.874Z`, and changelog `Add balance adjustment approval / 新增调账审批流`.
- Update task `#35` used OTA artifact `incudal-v0.2.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz`, downloaded `89919195` bytes, verified SHA256 `6a4f9551fe3b5abde60bded0e672f1c1a4f0a09babd49b7fc66326ee757dd6b8`, applied migration `20260624193000_add_balance_adjustment_requests`, switched `/opt/incudal/current`, restarted `incudal-backend`, reached backend health on the second attempt, and passed live `verify-split-host` before the proof command tail.
- Operational note: task `#33` first failed because the root filesystem was full while PostgreSQL applied the migration. OTA temp downloads under `/opt/incudal/.incudal-update-downloads` were cleaned, freeing about 9 GB. Task `#34` then hit Prisma `P3009` because the failed migration row remained. The database had no partial table or enum residue, so `prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back 20260624193000_add_balance_adjustment_requests` was applied before task `#35`.
- Final database proof for migration `20260624193000_add_balance_adjustment_requests` shows one rolled-back failed row and one finished successful row, which is expected after the failed disk-space attempt and retry.
- Public post-OTA proof for `v0.2.4` passed: `https://pay.payincus.com/api/health` and `https://admin.payincus.com/api/health` returned HTTP 200, `https://admin.payincus.com/admin/orders` returned HTTP 200, anonymous `https://admin.payincus.com/api/balance/admin/adjustment-requests` returned HTTP 401, and the public admin bundle contains the new `adjustment-requests` API marker.
- A redacted server-side `PROOF_SINCE_HOURS=72 pnpm verify:production-proof-snapshot` emitted observational proof for two online hosts, two fresh online Agents, two ZFS storage pools, five running instances, one completed recharge/callback, SMTP/Lsky config presence, zero notification channels/logs, and missing lifecycle actions `instance.start`, `instance.restart`, `instance.recreate`, and `instance.delete`. The SSH session was manually interrupted after JSON output stopped, so treat it as observational evidence rather than a clean command-exit proof.
- Production `/opt/incudal/current/server/package.json` reports `update:online:start` as `node dist/scripts/start-system-update-task.js`.
- Production Nginx roots now point at `/opt/incudal/current/client/dist/user` and `/opt/incudal/current/client/dist/admin`, so frontend static assets follow atomic OTA releases.
- Public `https://admin.payincus.com/admin/plugins` returns HTTP 200 and current admin JS assets contain `/admin/plugins`, `扩展中心`, and `admin-instance-detail` markers.
- Latest public non-auth recheck passed: live health endpoints, protected adjustment-request API 401 protection, admin order page HTTP 200, docs TLS, `v0.2.4` release assets, public admin bundle marker scan, and public root/API security headers.
- Public header checks on `https://pay.payincus.com/`, `https://admin.payincus.com/`, `https://pay.payincus.com/api/health`, and `https://admin.payincus.com/api/health` returned HSTS, CSP with `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.
- `v0.1.8` public release asset availability was verified directly. GitHub Actions API polling hit an anonymous rate limit during that check, so the latest fully recorded Actions run IDs in this handoff remain the earlier `v0.1.6` chain.
- Docs apex DNS is still incomplete for resilience: public resolvers currently return only A `185.199.108.153` and AAAA `2606:50c0:8000::153` for `payincus.com`, not the full recommended GitHub Pages record set.
- Full-function audit progress is complete for the current operator-approved scope. Category `13/13` is closed with Lsky confirmed deletion/provider cleanup recorded as an explicit scope waiver, not as a tested delete proof.

Storage-pool note:

- Debian 12 is supported. The current failure was caused by choosing ZFS on a host/kernel where `modprobe zfs` fails, not by Debian 12 itself.
- New storage-pool creation now defaults to LVM and lists LVM before ZFS.
- If Incus returns `not authorized`, rerun a fresh host install command on the real Incus host to refresh the `panel` trust entry.
- If Incus returns `Error loading "zfs" module` or `modprobe: FATAL: Module zfs not found`, install matching headers and make `zfs-dkms`/`modprobe zfs` work, or use LVM/Btrfs/DIR.

## Plugin Center Status

Plugin center development has been committed, pushed and released as `v0.0.12`.

Implemented backend scope:

- Prisma schema and migration for plugins, plugin versions, install tasks, plugin configs, market sources, event logs and user plugin data.
- Admin API under `/api/admin/plugins` for list/detail, upload install, GitHub market install, enable, disable, uninstall, config and task logs.
- User API under `/api/plugins` for enabled client extensions, public config, plugin action placeholder and sandboxed plugin assets.
- Package validation for `.tar.gz` uploads, manifest validation, path traversal rejection, link rejection, SHA256 calculation, staging extraction and entry/template file checks.
- Market index support through `PLUGIN_MARKET_INDEX_URL`, restricted to GitHub-hosted indexes and GitHub Release artifact download URLs with SHA256 verification.

Implemented frontend scope:

- Admin route `/admin/plugins` and extension center page for upload install, market install, enable/disable/uninstall, config JSON and task log viewing.
- User route `/plugins/:pathMatch(.*)*` for plugin-provided user pages.
- User sidebar extension point `user.sidebar.extra` rendered through sandboxed plugin frames.
- User and admin API clients remain separated; user client does not expose `/admin/plugins`.

Templates and docs:

- `plugin-templates/basic-admin-plugin`
- `plugin-templates/user-sidebar-plugin`
- `plugin-templates/admin-user-mixed-plugin`
- Chinese docs under `docs-site/docs/plugins/`
- English docs under `docs-site/docs/en/plugins/`

Deployment/OTA changes:

- `.env.example`, `scripts/install-panel.sh`, and `deploy/incudal-backend.service.example` include plugin env vars and runtime directories.
- Online update and rollback preserve/recreate `plugins`, `plugin-data`, `plugin-logs` and `plugin-staging`.

Important plugin commands:

```bash
pnpm --filter server test:plugin-center-guards
pnpm --filter server test:plugin-package-guards
pnpm --filter server test:plugin-market-guards
pnpm --filter server test:plugin-client-boundary-guards
```

Release proof:

- Commit: `0453d5a Add extension center`
- Version log commit: `6e8ce21 Update version log for v0.0.12`
- Tag: `v0.0.12`

- Admin extension center now:
  - displays the known AI plugin as `AI 工单助手` even when an older installed manifest still has English text;
  - shows Chinese description and permission labels;
  - links enabled plugins with `admin.plugins.settings` to standalone settings routes;
  - no longer embeds the settings iframe or raw config JSON in the extension center detail panel.

Official AI plugin standalone settings proof:

- Commit: `b4d4cce Add standalone plugin settings pages / 新增独立插件设置页`
- Tag: `v0.4.0`
- Release URL: `https://github.com/VipMaxxxx/payincus/releases/tag/v0.4.0`
- Production version file reports `v0.4.0`, git commit `b4d4cce11319`.
- Admin sidebar dynamically loads enabled extensions that declare `admin.plugins.settings` and inserts the settings entry after `扩展中心`.
- `AI 工单助手` now opens as `/admin/plugins/com.payincus.ai-ticket-agent/settings`.
- The standalone page provides Chinese business controls for enablement, takeover mode, OpenAI-compatible model URL, model name, API key, temperature, timeout, auto-reply categories, confidence threshold, limits, cooldown, AI identity disclosure and custom system prompt.
- Leaving the API key blank keeps the stored encrypted secret unchanged.
- Production admin assets contain the standalone page markers `自动回复策略`, `OpenAI 兼容接口地址`, `模型 API Key`, and `留空则保持不变`, and no longer contain `配置 JSON` or `套用默认模板`.

## Documentation Site

Documentation site is implemented under `docs-site/`.

Technology:

- VitePress
- Chinese default route: `/`
- English route: `/en/`
- Auto-generated system version logs from Git tags and commits.

Important files:

- VitePress config: `docs-site/docs/.vitepress/config.ts`
- Docs package: `docs-site/package.json`
- Git changelog generator: `docs-site/scripts/generate-changelog.mjs`
- GitHub Pages workflow: `.github/workflows/docs-pages.yml`
- GitHub Pages root-domain CNAME: `docs-site/docs/public/CNAME`

Current docs domain:

```text
https://payincus.com
https://payincus.com/en/
```

GitHub Pages deployment:

- Repository: `VipMaxxxx/payincus`
- Pages source: GitHub Actions
- Custom domain: `payincus.com`
- DNS apex records should point to GitHub Pages:

```text
A @ 185.199.108.153
A @ 185.199.109.153
A @ 185.199.110.153
A @ 185.199.111.153
```

Optional IPv6:

```text
AAAA @ 2606:50c0:8000::153
AAAA @ 2606:50c0:8001::153
AAAA @ 2606:50c0:8002::153

```

Useful docs commands:

```bash
pnpm docs:install
pnpm docs:changelog
pnpm docs:build
pnpm docs:preview
```

Direct docs-site commands:

```bash
pnpm --dir docs-site install --ignore-workspace
pnpm --dir docs-site --ignore-workspace build
pnpm --dir docs-site --ignore-workspace preview
```

Known docs build behavior:

- `docs-site/docs/.vitepress/dist/`, `.temp/`, and `docs-site/node_modules/` are ignored.
- `docs-site/pnpm-lock.yaml` should be committed.
- `docs-site/docs/public/CNAME` must stay `payincus.com`.

## Last Known Verification

Recently passed locally for the latest shipped code path:

```text
pnpm --filter server test:frontend-route-guards
pnpm --filter client type-check
pnpm --filter client build
pnpm --filter server test:frontend-dist-boundary-guards
pnpm --filter client lint:check

pnpm docs:changelog
pnpm --dir docs-site --ignore-workspace build
git diff --check
```

Recently refreshed public production checks after the `v0.2.0` OTA upgrade:

```text
FRONTEND_URL=https://pay.payincus.com ADMIN_FRONTEND_URL=https://admin.payincus.com BACKEND_URL=https://pay.payincus.com VERIFY_RETRIES=2 VERIFY_RETRY_DELAY=1 pnpm verify:split:host
```

Production `/opt/incudal/current` resolves to `/opt/incudal/releases/v0.2.0-20260624093816`; `version.json` reports `v0.2.0`, commit `01731f693610`, build time `2026-06-24T09:36:26.844Z`, and `deployedAt=2026-06-24T09:38:25.047Z`. Production OTA task `#29` also ran `pnpm verify:production` and `pnpm verify:log-header` successfully during the update.

Recent live business proof:

- Server-side redacted snapshot on production `v0.1.6` emitted observational proof for two online hosts, two fresh online Agents, two ZFS storage pools, five running instances, one completed recharge/callback, SMTP/Lsky config presence, and zero notification channels/logs.
- Production hosts `HKCMI-01` and `JPIIJ-01` are online/installed/API-enabled in the latest observational snapshot.
- Host Agents are enabled and online with fresh `lastSeenAt`, version `v0.0.1`, and capabilities `heartbeat`, `report`, `host-metrics`, `instance-status`, and `traffic-counters`.
- Agent `lastReport` contains `incus`, `metrics`, `resources`, and `runtime`; traffic snapshots and daily traffic rows exist for both running instances.
- A completed real recharge exists with actual amount, fee, third-party trade number and callback timestamp; a processed payment callback row exists with callback IP present. Full order number, provider config and callback body were intentionally not printed.
- Live operation logs show SSH key generation, recharge completion, instance create, instance stop, instance rebuild, terminal connect/disconnect, Agent install token consumption, Debian 12 instance create, and NAT port-add successes.
- Interpretation: real payment callback, Agent heartbeat/report, resource/instance/traffic reporting, Incus create, stop, start, restart, rebuild, recreate, delete/cleanup, NAT port add, storage, and Web terminal connect/disconnect are now live-proven.

Manual plugin package proof also passed with `plugin-templates/admin-user-mixed-plugin` packaged as `.tar.gz` and validated by `validateAndExtractPluginPackage`; result had id `com.example.coupon`, one admin page, one user page, one template and 64-char SHA256.

Earlier full product gates already passed before the docs/plugin work:

```text
pnpm --filter client build
pnpm --filter server test:frontend-dist-boundary-guards
pnpm build
pnpm --filter server test:frontend-route-guards
pnpm --filter client lint:check
pnpm --filter server type-check
pnpm test
pnpm test:agent
git diff --check
```

Only rerun the full suite when relevant production code changes occur. For docs-only changes, docs build plus link/format checks are usually enough.

## Production Audit Status

`docs/production-audit.md` currently says progress is about 99%.

Completed:

- Non-Docker split deployment path.
- User/admin frontend split and bundle boundary guards.
- Local build/test gates.
- Live HTTPS smoke for the production split hosts.
- OTA artifact update path.
- Atomic OTA layout and rollback proof.
- Bilingual docs site and GitHub Pages deployment.
- Plugin center API production smoke.
- Host installer certificate-refresh hotfix.
- Agent installer compact-manifest hotfix.
- Panel-to-Incus storage-list proof for the registered host's existing `default` ZFS pool.
- Live payment callback proof.
- Live Agent heartbeat/resource/instance/traffic proof.
- Live Incus create, stop, rebuild, NAT port add, storage, Web terminal connect/disconnect, and Debian 12 instance proof.

Not completed:

- Final real production business proof.

Remaining production proof item:

- Real Lsky confirmed deletion/provider cleanup.

Optional follow-up if final acceptance scope expands:

- Real suspend/unsuspend, IPv6, and host migration smoke.
- Additional plugin iframe rendering proof once a real enabled plugin exists.

## Current Server Access Note

Password-authenticated SSH was available again during the 2026-06-25 proof pass. A read-only recheck at `2026-06-25T03:57:08.849Z` confirmed Turnstile restored, temp secret file removed, and temporary test users banned.

SSH has still been intermittently closed by the remote service during non-interactive commands. A 2026-06-25 09:34 UTC retry closed before command execution, but a later 2026-06-25 10:00 UTC retry succeeded: `/opt/incudal/current` still pointed to `v0.5.6`, and the read-only Lsky preflight ran but still returned HTTP 403 for `/api/v2/user/photos`. Prefer short read-only commands or an interactive shell for production proof, and never paste server passwords into handoff notes.

## Important Production Domains

Current known domains:

- Product/user production: `https://pay.payincus.com`
- Admin production: `https://admin.payincus.com`
- User site in docs: `https://pay.payincus.com`
- Admin site in docs: `https://admin.payincus.com`
- Documentation/root site: `https://payincus.com`
- Telegram group: `https://t.me/Payincus`

Note: a previous request excluded the old demo domain from production audit scope. Public README/docs and example configs now use the current production user/admin domains instead.

## Suggested Next Work

1. Keep local Git synced with remote `payincus/main`; before this handoff refresh, the tracked baseline is `05b0517`.
2. Continue commercial operation target 12 from `docs/commercial-operation-task-goals.md`; commercial operation is 12/12 categories with 100% local function coverage, and production proof is complete for the current operator-approved scope.
3. Treat `v0.6.9` production deployment/readiness as the latest proven production deployment from the 2026-06-26 SSH and public HTTP proof: `/opt/incudal/current -> /opt/incudal/releases/v0.6.9-20260626053655`, version commit `369212f8e2a3`, deployed at `2026-06-26T05:37:16.617Z`, user/admin health passed, online plugin/theme market indexes returned HTTP 200, and OTA task `#75` completed successfully.
4. Current latest-production boundary: `v0.6.9` is live and proven via task `#75`. Current proof-scope boundary remains `v0.6.6` task `#73`: Lsky cleanup is not proven because the configured production Lsky token only has `upload:write`, is missing `user:photo:read` and `user:photo:write`, returned HTTP 403 for the documented user-gallery list API, and the production DB/log known-ID search did not find a safe persisted proof image ID to delete. The operator explicitly waived this cleanup test from final scope, so do not claim confirmed deletion unless a future delete-capable proof is collected.
5. Treat the core Incus lifecycle as proven on a dedicated test instance: #9 on host #2 completed stop/start/restart/recreate/delete cleanup, and existing proof already covers create, rebuild, terminal connect/disconnect, NAT port add, storage, Agent reports, and traffic. Only run suspend/unsuspend, IPv6, or host-migration smoke if these remain in final acceptance scope.
6. Delivery proof: SMTP provider reference is proven by `smtp-provider-reference-2026-06-25T04:34:51.773Z`; Telegram delivery is proven by message `#339` to `@Payincus`; Lsky cleanup is waived for current final scope. If it is later required, it still needs a delete-capable token or provider-side cleanup before commit-mode proof. The target endpoint is `DELETE /api/v2/user/photos` with a JSON numeric ID array; do not use guessed IDs or invalid/empty delete probes as proof.
7. Treat production DB backup/restore drill as proven: `scripts/production-db-restore-drill.sh` created a `601026` byte custom dump, restored it into temporary database `incudal_restore_drill_20260625023234_126219`, validated public table/migration/user/instance/update-task counts, removed the temp workdir, and `pg_database` returned `0` for the temp DB afterward.
8. Treat the approved temporary Turnstile disable-and-restore smoke as proven unless final acceptance specifically requires a human-solved Cloudflare challenge UX.
9. Latest proof-scope live acceptance is already recorded at `/tmp/incudal-proof/final-acceptance-v0.6.6.md` with real proof references and `LIVE_LSKY_CLEANUP_WAIVER_REF`. The later extension platform work is deployed in `v0.6.9` with online market proof. Only rerun `pnpm verify:final-acceptance` if final scope explicitly requires a fresh auth smoke or human-solved Turnstile challenge.
10. If creating an additional ZFS pool still fails, fix or avoid ZFS on that Incus host; the existing `default` ZFS pool already lists through Incus.
11. Decide whether to continue improving docs:
   - Page-by-page admin field explanations.
   - User workflow screenshots.
   - API request/response/error reference.
   - Payment provider setup guide.
   - Agent install guide with real host commands.
12. Complete remaining real production proof items from `docs/production-audit.md`.
13. When a real production proof is completed, update `docs/production-audit.md` with exact date, command/evidence, and outcome.

## Release Documentation Rule

When a new feature or complete bugfix bundle is completed, publish one OTA version for that completed unit of work, and keep GitHub plus the docs site in sync. Do not publish an OTA for every tiny intermediate fix. Handoff-only, audit-only, and non-behavior documentation changes usually do not need an OTA.

Versioning rule:

- Use three-part semantic tags: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
- Patch values only run from `0` through `9`.
- After `v0.0.9`, the next version is `v0.1.0`, not `v0.0.10`.
- After `v0.9.9`, the next version is `v1.0.0`.
- Existing historical tags remain unchanged; apply this rule to future releases.
- Version-log section labels and commit subject labels must be bilingual Chinese/English.

Required AI development lifecycle:

```text
Implement feature
  -> run automatic acceptance / guard checks
  -> run targeted and relevant full tests
  -> fix any failures
  -> publish one OTA version for the completed feature/fix bundle
  -> regenerate version logs
  -> update missing Chinese and English docs
  -> build docs site
  -> commit and push everything
```

Required release steps:

1. Commit the code change with a clear commit message that can be used in the public version log.
2. Create/publish one OTA tag and GitHub Release artifact for the completed feature/fix bundle. Do not leave completed product features only on `main` without an OTA version.
3. Regenerate the docs-site version logs:

```bash
pnpm docs:changelog
```

This updates:

```text
docs-site/docs/release/version-log.md
docs-site/docs/en/release/version-log.md
```

4. If the OTA changes user-visible behavior, admin behavior, deployment steps, config, API, Agent behavior, payment flow, resource delivery, or troubleshooting behavior, update the matching docs page in `docs-site/docs/` and `docs-site/docs/en/`.
5. Run the docs build before publishing:

```bash
pnpm --dir docs-site --ignore-workspace build
```

6. Commit and push the docs changes so GitHub Pages updates `payincus.com`.

Do not publish an OTA that changes behavior while leaving the public docs and version logs stale. Also do not mark a new feature complete unless its OTA version, Git tag, GitHub Release artifact, docs version log, and any missing feature docs are updated together.

Acceptance rule:

- A feature is not considered complete immediately after code changes.
- It is complete only after automatic acceptance checks pass, relevant tests pass, the OTA version is published, the version logs are regenerated, and the docs site is updated for any changed behavior.
- For auth, payment, permissions, OTA, Agent, resource delivery, and production deployment changes, include the relevant guard scripts and document any remaining live proof requirement in `docs/production-audit.md`.

## Safety Notes

- Do not include server passwords, API secrets, payment keys, SMTP passwords, Telegram tokens, Lsky tokens, or GitHub tokens in summaries or docs.
- Treat auth, payment, permissions, OTA, Agent, and resource delivery as high-risk.
- Do not revert user changes or staged files without explicit approval.
- Before changing backend/admin/user boundary code, read existing guards and update tests with the change.
