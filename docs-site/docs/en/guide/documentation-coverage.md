# Documentation Coverage

This page defines the usability standard for PayIncus documentation. The docs are not just product copy; they are the operating manual for installation, deployment, third-party development, API integration, and production operations. Public documentation must match the current repository code, scripts, routes, environment variables, and deployment layout.

## Usability Standard

| Area | Required outcome | Authoritative source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Installation | A new operator can complete one-click install, domain setup, backend startup, and first access | `scripts/install-panel.sh` |
| Manual deployment | Operators can build user/admin frontends and backend, then configure systemd and Nginx | `package.json`, `deploy/`, `scripts/verify-split-host.sh` |
| Environment | Documented variables must be read by code or scripts, with accurate defaults and risk notes | `scripts/install-panel.sh`, `server/src/config`, `server/src/lib/runtime-settings.ts` |
| OTA | Admins can understand Release artifacts, SHA256, tasks, logs, rollback, and atomic release layout | `server/src/routes/system-update.ts`, `server/src/scripts/run-system-update-task.ts` |
| Agent | Host operators can install the Agent and understand certs, heartbeat, resource reports, and failures | `server/templates/`, `agent/`, `server/src/routes/agent*.ts` |
| Delivery | Packages, plans, storage pools, stock, bandwidth, traffic, upgrades, and capacity checks match implementation | `server/src/routes/instances.ts`, `server/src/routes/instance-billing.ts`, `server/src/db/hosts.ts` |
| Billing | Recharge, balance, billing records, callbacks, reconciliation, adjustments, and refunds keep high-risk boundaries | `server/src/routes/orders.ts`, `server/src/routes/admin-billing.ts` |
| Extensions | Third parties can build extensions with admin config, user pages, events, actions, and marketplace publishing | `server/src/lib/plugin-manifest.ts`, `plugin-templates/` |
| Themes | Third parties can package, upload, preview, enable, rollback, and submit themes | `server/src/lib/theme-package.ts`, `theme-templates/` |
| Public API | Endpoints, auth, scopes, pagination, sorting, errors, and SDK examples match routes | `server/src/routes/public-api.ts`, `server/src/lib/public-api-openapi.ts` |
| Troubleshooting | Common failures include commands, log paths, and safe remediation steps | `scripts/verify-*`, systemd, Nginx, OTA logs |

## Current Coverage

The documentation currently covers:

- Product scope, roles, architecture, and production split deployment.
- One-click install, manual deployment, Nginx, systemd, environment variables, and production acceptance.
- User portal, admin console, instance delivery, billing, payments, communication, hosting, and resource pools.
- Host Agent installation, heartbeat, resource reports, and delivery boundaries.
- Admin OTA, Release artifacts, SHA256, atomic `current/releases` layout, and rollback.
- Extension Center, manifest, config forms, client slots, events, actions, storage, templates, and marketplace submissions.
- Theme system, manifest, CSS/HTML safety checks, config forms, template slots, theme marketplace, and rollback.
- OAuth Provider, Public API, OpenAPI, Bearer tokens, scopes, pagination, sorting, error model, and SDK.
- Common issues and production proof checks.

## Maintenance Rule

Update the docs whenever any of these change:

- Environment variables.
- Public API endpoints, OAuth scopes, or SDK methods.
- One-click install, Nginx, systemd, OTA, or Agent scripts.
- Packages, resources, instance delivery, balance, payments, refunds, risk controls, or permissions.
- Extension manifest, actions, events, slots, storage, or marketplace publishing.
- Theme manifest, template slots, config fields, asset validation, or marketplace publishing.

Documentation that touches authentication, payments, permissions, resource delivery, balance, OTA, extensions, or themes must include risk boundaries and verification steps.

## Verification Commands

Before publishing docs, run at least:

```bash
pnpm --dir docs-site --ignore-workspace build
pnpm --filter server test:frontend-i18n-keys
rg "old source keyword or old contributor name" README.md docs-site
```

For deployment, OTA, extension, theme, or API docs, also run the relevant guards:

```bash
pnpm --filter server test:system-update-guards
pnpm --filter server test:plugin-package-guards
pnpm --filter server test:plugin-runtime-capabilities-guards
pnpm --filter server test:plugin-client-boundary-guards
pnpm --filter server test:theme-system-guards
pnpm --filter server test:public-api-openapi-guards
```
